Comments For The Authors

• On page 1, I had not seen this property of the Weil pairing called
“Weil reciprocity” before.  Please check this is standard terminology.

• Section 2 accounts for nearly half the paper, but only gets a brief
mention in the introduction.  If the results are too technical to
state in the introduction, perhaps you could give some of the examples
to motivate your work instead?

• I found Section 2 (especially Lemma 2.4) much easier to read when I
realized that “condition (S)” is simply the condition that the image G
of the mod p Galois representation is not contained in a (split or
nonsplit) Cartan subgroup. This is easy to prove directly. Indeed for
the non-trivial implication, if h ∈ GL 2 (F p ) centralizes G, and det
h is not a square, then h is not a scalar matrix, and it has distinct
eigenvalues (in F p ). Then G is contained in the centralizer of h,
which is a Cartan subgroup. Proposition 1.1 (if still needed) is then
a corollary.

• On page 4, ”They may be found in [21]”. This reference only gives
  equations for the + case.

• I suggest shortening Sections 2.1 and 2.2. The first few paragraphs
of Section 2.1 give useful background, and the numbered equations will
obviously be useful later on, but the discussion of one type of twist
being a special case of another seems overdone. Surely the usual
convention is that an elliptic curve is a quadratic twist of itself?
If the authors have a different convention then this should be
explained. The attempt to define the order of a twist is somewhat
unhelpful, since the definition given might depend on the choice of t.

• The proof of Lemma 2.4 in the case j = 0 and p = 3 currently makes
no use of the hypotheses that E is p-congruent to a twist. This cannot
be correct, since if E/Q is the elliptic curve y 2 = x 3 + 1 then E[3]
satisfies condition (S), but is reducible. Also the sentence before
the lemma appears to ignore the possibility (condition (B) in
Proposition 1.1) that (S) is satisfied, but the image of Galois is
abelian. In the proof you could be a bit more explicit when you write
“contradicting (2.7)”, i.e. what is the contradiction? In the final
paragraph of the proof it might be worth highlighting the importance
of the assumption that p is odd.

• The proof of (1) on page 10 seems to take an unnecessary excursion
via Frobenius elements.  Can’t you just take traces in (2.5) directly?

• In the proof of Corollary 2.6, and again before Example 2.18, you
quote a fact about the image of Galois for a CM elliptic curve with
good reduction. Could you give a reference for this?

• In the proof of Corollary 2.6, why do you want a cyclic isogeny? For
D / = 4 it seems the case-by-case computation could be replaced by the
observation that the order of discriminant √ −D contains −D and this
has norm D.

• Paragraph before Lemma 2.8. In the first sentence I do not see the
conclusion that the image of Galois is cyclic. For example, it could
be C 2 × C 2 generated by −I and an antidiagonal matrix. Does “in our
context” mean “in the context of Proposition 2.5”?

• Theorem 2.9 allows p = 3, but refers in its statement to Proposition
2.5 which does not. You might consider re-wording Lemma 2.8 so that
you can refer to its statement rather than its proof.

• At the top of page 20 you write “determine the symplectic type” and
towards the end of page 22 “by the results of Section 2”. The comment
about condition (S) in the case K = Q, which is made immediately
following Proposition 1.1, would surely be worth repeating somewhere
in Section 3.

• Proposition 3.4 is correct, but its proof is not. The problem is
with the claim in the second line of the proof that φ(D) = D. A
counterexample would be to take H = B and φ to be conjugation by a
generator for U . It might be helpful to note that the image of D in
PGL 2 (F p ) is cyclic, and start the proof by picking a generator for
that.

• In Proposition 3.5 and Theorem 3.6, why do you exclude p = 2?

• The proof of Theorem 3.6 begins “Clearly”. One method would be to
check that all index p subgroups in H are conjugate. However the
comments on the next page about fields of definitions of isogenies
give a simpler proof. Perhaps these comments should be made sooner?

Smaller Comments And Type Errors

• p1, standardize F^×_p and F^*_p .

• p2, Proposition 1.1, “or if and only if” → “equivalently if and only
if”. Second paragraph after the proof, “symplectic” → “symplectic
type”.

• p3, “in LMFDB” → “in the LMFDB”

• p4, Since in the statement of Frey-Mazur you specify p strictly
bigger than C, surely it is expected to hold for C = 17 (and not just C
= 18). Same comment at the bottom of page 27.

• p4, “of order multiple of p” → “of order p”

• p4, “not be useful in practice”. You could be more specific – is it
that the bounds are hard to compute, or end up being too large? Near
the top of the next page are “the bounds” on ell?

• p5, The second sentence of Section 2 is too vague to be helpful –
  “all types” in what sense?

• p7, “This is most easily seen”. This is also easily seen by
considering the long exact sequence of 1 → μ 2 → μ 4 → μ 2 → 1.

• p8, “twisting by the cocycle” → “by twisted by the cocycle”, “so
symplectic type” → “so the symplectic type”.

• p14, Lemma 2.13, “extending scalars to”. No need for the
star. Second line of proof, “∈” → “⊂”. 4th line of proof, what is not
a scalar?

• p14-15, standardize {3, 4, 6} and {4, 3, 6}.

• p20, “Assume also B is large enough that p ∈ / L_B ”. If p ∈ L_B
then increasing B isn’t going to change this.

• p21, “sizes between 2 and 76” and “sizes up to 80”. Why are these
  numbers different?

• p28, “has to occurs” → “has to occur”
