\section{Introduction}

Let $p \geq 3$ be a prime. Write $G_\Q = \Gal(\Qbar/\Q)$ for the
absolute Galois group of $\Q$.  Let $E$ and $E'$ be elliptic curves defined over $\Q$, and write $E[p]$ and $E'[p]$ for their $p$-torsion $G_\Q$-modules.

Let $\phi : E[p] \to E'[p]$ be an isomorphism of $G_\Q$-modules.
There is an element $d(\phi) \in \F_p^\times$ such that the Weil 
pairings~$e_{E,p}$ and~$e_{E',p}$ satisfy
\[
e_{E',p}(\phi(P), \phi(Q)) = e_{E,p}(P, Q)^{d(\phi)}
\]
for all $P, Q \in E[p]$.  We say that $\phi$ is a {\em symplectic
  isomorphism} or an {\em anti-symplectic isomorphism} if $d(\phi)$ is
a square or a non-square modulo~$p$, respectively.  When two elliptic
curves have isomorphic $p$-torsion modules we say that there is a
mod~$p$ {\em congruence} between them, or that they are {\em
  congruent} mod~$p$.

For example, suppose that~$\phi$ is induced by an isogeny (also
denoted~$\phi$) from $E$ to $E'$, of degree $\deg(\phi)$ coprime
to~$p$. Then, using Weil reciprocity, 
we have 
\[
  e_{E',p}(\phi(P), \phi(Q)) = e_{E,p}(P, \hat\phi\phi(Q)) =
  e_{E,p}(P, \deg(\phi)(Q)) = e_{E,p}(P, Q)^{\deg(\phi)},
  \]
  where $\hat{\phi}$ denotes the dual isogeny; 
  thus $d(\phi)=\deg\phi\pmod{p}$.
  Hence $\phi$ is symplectic or antisymplectic according as $\deg\phi$
is a quadratic residue or nonresidue mod~$p$, respectively.  We will refer to
this condition as the \emph{isogeny criterion}.

Given $G_\Q$-isomorphic modules $E[p]$ and~$E'[p]$, it is possible
they admit isomorphisms with both symplectic types; this occurs if and only if $E[p]$ admits an anti-symplectic automorphism. 
The following proposition shows this phenomenon can occur only 
for $p < 7$ hence, when a $G_\Q$-isomorphism $\phi : E[p] \simeq E'[p]$ exists, normally there is only one possible symplectic type for any such~$\phi$; in particular, this will be the case for all the isomorphisms we consider in this work. 
For an example where both types exist, take $p=5$ and
$E$, $E'$ to be the curves\footnote{Throughout the paper we use
Cremona labels for elliptic curves over~$\Q$; these curves may be
found in the LMFDB (see \cite{lmfdb}).} $\lmfdbec{11}{a}{1}$ and
$\lmfdbec{1342}{c}{2}$, respectively (see~\cite[Example~5.2]{FKSym}
for more details).

\begin{proposition}\label{P:auto}
  Let $E$ and~$E'$ be elliptic curves defined over~$\Q$ such that
  $E[p]\cong E'[p]$ as $G_\Q$-modules.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $E[p]$ is irreducible, then the isomorphism $E[p]\cong
      E'[p]$ is unique up to scaling; hence its symplectic type is
      well-defined.
      \item If $p\ge7$ then the same conclusion also holds when
        $E[p]$ is reducible.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof} See~\cite[Corollary~3 and Proposition~2]{FKSym}
\end{proof}

\begin{comment}
both have $5$-torsion Galois module isomorphic to $\mu_5
\times \Z/5\Z$.  Now let $P,Q \in E[5]$ and $P',Q' \in E'[5]$ be bases
such that $P$, $P'$ are defined over~$\Q$.  The map defined by $P
\mapsto P'$ and $Q \mapsto n\cdot Q'$ (with $5 \nmid n$) is a
$G_\Q$-isomorphism which is symplectic if and only if $n$ is a square
mod~$5$.  Moreover, the automorphism $\alpha$ of $E[5]$ given by
$\alpha(P) = P$ and $\alpha(Q) = 2Q$ is anti-symplectic because $2$ is
not a square modulo~$5$.
\end{comment}

It is then natural to consider triples $(E,E',p)$ where $E/\Q$ and $E'/\Q$ are elliptic
curves with isomorphic $p$-torsion such that the $G_\Q$-modules
isomorphisms $\phi : E[p] \rightarrow E'[p]$ are either all symplectic
or all anti-symplectic.  In this case, we will say that the {\em
  symplectic type} of $(E,E',p)$ is respectively symplectic or
anti-symplectic.  The problem of determining the symplectic of
$(E,E',p)$ was extensively studied by the second author and Alain
Kraus in~\cite{FKSym}.

The isogeny criterion gives an easy solution when $(E,E',p)$
arises from an isogeny $h \colon E \to E'$ of degree~$n$ coprime
to~$p$, since in such cases $d(h|_{E[p]}) = n$ and the symplectic type
of $(E,E',p)$ is symplectic if $n$ is a square mod~$p$ and
anti-symplectic otherwise.

Given a generic triple $(E, E', p)$, in principle, one
could compute the $p$-torsion fields of $E$ and $E'$,
write down the Galois action on $E[p]$ and $E'[p]$ and check if they
are symplectically or anti-symplectically isomorphic. However, the
degree of the $p$-torsion fields grows very fast with~$p$ making this
method not practical already for $p = 5$.

One way to circumvent this computational problem is to use the methods
presented in~\cite{FKSym}. Indeed, the main objective of {\it loc. cit.} was to establish a complete list of {\em local symplectic criteria},
allowing one to determine the symplectic type of $(E,E',p)$ using only
standard information about the local curves $E/\Q_\ell$ and
$E'/\Q_\ell$ at a single prime $\ell \neq p$ and congruence conditions
on~$p$. Further, it is also proved in~\cite{FKSym}  that if the
symplectic type of~$(E,E',p)$ is encoded in local information at a
single prime $\ell \neq p$, then one of the local criteria will
successfully determine it.  
There are cases where the local methods
are insufficient: however, this can occur only when the image
of the $p$-torsion representation~$\rhobar_{E,p} : G_\Q \to \GL_2(\F_p)$ attached to~$E$ contains no elements of order~$p$;
see \cite[Proposition~16]{FKSym} for such an example.

The main objectives of this paper are: {\bf to give global criteria for the
symplectic type of congruences when the local methods of \cite{FKSym}
do not apply, specifically when the projective images are dihedral;} to
study congruences between twists; and to systematically identify and
determine the symplectic type of all congruences between curves in the
LMFDB (see \cite{lmfdb})
%%of conductors up to~$\numprint{400000}$
for all~$p\ge7$.

%% to give a uniform procedure to
%% determine, for a few small~$p$, the symplectic type of
%% triples~$(E,E',p)$ independently of the image of~$\rhobar_{E,p}$.

For the latter objective, we have implemented in {\Magma} \cite{magma}
and {\Sage} \cite{sage} the methods from this paper together with
those from~\cite{FKSym}. We have used our code to classify the
symplectic types of congruences between curves in the LMFDB, namely
all elliptic curves defined over~$\Q$ of conductor less
than~$\numprint{400000}$. More precisely, Theorem~\ref{T:cong19} shows
there are no mod~$p$ congruences in LMFDB for $p \geq 19$ and we
found, for $p$ in the range $7 \leq p \leq 17$, all the congruences in
the database; we report on the results obtained in
Section~\ref{S:statistics}~and~\ref{S:Frey-Mazur}.

The description of our method also includes a discussion on how to
determine whether $E[p]$ and~$E'[p]$ are isomorphic (ignoring the
symplectic structure) in both the irreducible and reducible
cases. Moreover, we give global symplectic criteria for particular
types of congruences: Theorem~\ref{T:Cartan} covers congruences
between an elliptic curve~$E$ with mod~$p$ image in the normalizer of
a Cartan subgroup and a certain quadratic twist of~$E$ and
Theorem~\ref{T:j=0} covers a mod~$7$ congruence between elliptic
curves~$E$ with $j(E)=0$ and a sextic twist of~$E$.
\textbf{Revise this later so include more of the key results of
  section 2.}

\subsection{Previous work}
Our study of congruences between curves in the database follows on
from previous work by a number of authors.  The current first author
himself found many such congruences as his database expanded,
including the congruences mod~$17$ which were found in around~2017,
but these results were only circulated informally and not published.
The mod~$17$ congruence was rediscovered by Billerey
\cite{Billerey17}, who also determined its symplectic type, as had the
second author.  Fisher lists $11$-congruences for conductors up to
130,000, up to twist and isogeny, in \cite{FisherList}; that list also
includes congruences between curves in this range and curves outside
the current LMFDB range, found by finding rational points on the associated modular
curves.


\subsection{Modular parametrizations}
The modular curve $X(p)$ parametrizes elliptic curves with full
level~$p$ structure. It has genus~$0$ for $p=2,3,5$, genus~$3$ for
$p=7$ and genus~$\ge26$ for $p\ge11$.  Fixing an elliptic
curve~$E/\Q$, the curve $X_E(p)$, which is a twist of~$X(p)$ (and
hence has the same genus), parametrizes pairs $(E',\phi)$ such that
$\phi$ is a symplectic isomorphism~$E[p]\cong E'[p]$; similarly
$X_E^-(p)$ parametrizes antisymplectic isomorphisms. Note that the pair $(E,\id)$ constituted by $E$ itself and the identity map
gives a base point defined over~$\Q$ on~$X_E(p)$, while $X_E^-(p)$ may have no rational points.

It follows that congruences modulo~$p$ for $p\le 5$ are common.  There
are certainly many mod~$3$ and mod~$5$ congruences in the database,
but we have not searched for these systematically. Indeed, since
$X_E(3)$ and $X_E(5)$ have genus~0, for each fixed~$E$, there will
always be congruences that are not part of the database independently
of its range. In contrast, for primes~$p \geq 7$, the curve $X_E(p)$
has genus~$\geq 3$ and so for each~$E$ there are only finitely many
mod~$p$ congruences with~$E$, hence the database
might contain all such congruences; however proving this fact for a
fixed~$E$ is a hard problem.

For convenience 
we sometimes also write $X_E^+(p)$ to denote $X_E(p)$. 
By ``explicit equations'' for $X_E^{\pm}(p)$, we mean the
following.
\begin{itemize}
  \item An explicit model for a family of curves, with equations whose
    coefficients are polynomials in $\Q[a,b]$, such that specializing
    $a,b$ gives a model for $X_E^{\pm}(p)$ where $E$ is the elliptic
    curve with equation $Y^2=X^3=aX+b$; each rational point $P$ is
    either a cusp of the modular curve or encodes a pair $(E',\phi)$
    such that $(E,E', p)$ is a symplectic (respectively,
    antisymplectic) triple.
    \item A rational function with coefficients in $\Q(a,b)$ defining
      the map $j: X_E^{\pm}(p) \to \PP^1$, taking a point
      $P=(E',\phi)$ to $j(E')$.  The degree of this map is the
      index~$[\PSL_2(\Z):\Gamma(p)] = |\PSL_2(\F_p)|$: for example, when
        $p=7$ the degree is~$168$.
      \item Rational functions $c_4$ and $c_6$ such that for each
        non-cuspidal point~$P=(E',\phi)$, a model for $E'$ is
        $Y^2=X^3+a'X+b'$ where $(a',b')=(-27c_4(P),-54c_6(P))$.
\end{itemize}
For $p=3$ and~$p=5$, the curves themselves have genus~$0$ and hence we
do not need equations, but the formulas for $j$, $c_4$ and~$c_6$ are
still useful.  They may be found in \cite{Rubin-Silverberg}.

Equations for $X_E(7)$, in this sense, were obtained by Kraus and
Halberstadt in~\cite{Halberstadt-Kraus-XE7}, though the functions
$c_4$ and $c_6$ in \cite{Halberstadt-Kraus-XE7} are only defined away
from $5$ points (which may or may not be rational). Fisher gives more
complete equations for this, together with $X_E^-(7)$ and
$X_E^{\pm}(11)$, in~\cite{Fisher}.

%% Below we will study congruences modulo~$p$ systematically for~$p\ge7$,
%% giving more detail for $p=7$.  The number of congruences in the
%% database for $p=11$, $p=13$, and $p=17$ is small; in the latter case,
%% there is only one such congruence (up to twist), as noted in
%% \cite{Billerey17}.  An explicit form of the Frey-Mazur conjecture (see
%% below) asserts that there should exist no congruences modulo~$p>17$
%% apart from those induced by isogenies.


\subsection{Further motivation} \label{S:motivation}
We finish this introduction with a discussion on how the methods of
this paper complement the local methods in~\cite{FKSym}.

From the discussion so far we know that triples $(E,E',p)$ as above give rise to $\Q$-points on at least one of the modular curves~$X_E(p)$ or $X_E^-(p)$. 

The Frey-Mazur conjecture states there is a constant $C \geq 18$ such
that, if $E/\Q$ and $E'/\Q$ satisfy $E[p] \simeq E'[p]$ as
$G_\Q$-modules for some prime $p > C$, then $E$ and $E'$ are
$\Q$-isogenous. Theorem~\ref{T:cong19} shows that for curves of
conductor at most~$\numprint{400000}$, this holds with~$C=18$. In view
of this conjecture, any~$(E,E',p)$ with $p > C$ arises from an
isogeny, hence its symplectic type is easily determined by the isogeny
criterion. Thus we are interested in primes $p \leq C$.

%% For $p=3,5$ the modular curves $X(p)$  have genus~0, equations for $X_E(p)$ and $X_E^-(p)$ are well known and we can obtain infinitely many triples $(E,E',p)$ with each symplectic type. 

As mentioned above, it follows from~\cite{FKSym} that if no local
symplectic criterion applies to~$(E,E',p)$ then the image of
$\rhobar_{E,p}$ is irreducible and contains no element of
order~multiple of~$p$. Moreover, when $\rhobar_{E,p}$ is reducible
only the criteria at primes of multiplicative or good reduction may
succeed and often the bounds on a prime~$\ell$ for which a local
criterion at~$\ell$ applies may not be useful in practice.  From the
strong form of Serre's uniformity conjecture, these `bad' cases for
the local methods imply that either $E$ has Complex Multiplication
(CM) or one of the following holds:
\begin{itemize}
 \item[(i)] $p=3,5,7$ and $\rhobar_{E,p}$ is reducible or has image the normalizer of a Cartan subgroup;
 \item[(ii)] $p=11$ and $\rhobar_{E,p}$ has image the normalizer of non-split Cartan subgroup;
 \item[(iii)] $p=13$ and $\rhobar_{E,p}$ is reducible; 
 \item[(iv)] $p=13$ and $\rhobar_{E,p}$ has exceptional image projectively isomorphic to $S_4$;
 \item[(v)] $p=11,17$ or $37$, and $j(E)$ is listed
 in \cite[Table~2.1]{DahmenPhD}; in particular, $\rhobar_{E,p}$ is reducible.
\end{itemize}
The method we describe in Section~\ref{S:statistics} for $p=7$ can be
adapted by replacing the modular curves~$X_E(7)$ by $X_E(p)$ when
explicit equations for the latter are known, which is the case for
$p=3,5$ and~$11$. This method works independently of the image
of~$\rhobar_{E,p}$, so covers cases (i) and (ii) above.

In \cite[Corollary~1.9]{BarinderCrem} there is a list of~$3$ rational
$j$-invariants of elliptic curves over~$\Q$ satisfying~(iv); it has
recently been shown (see~\cite{BDMTV-S4}) that the associated
genus~$3$ modular curve~$X_{S_4}(13)$ found explicitly
in~\cite{BarinderCrem} has no more rational points, and hence that
this list is complete. By Proposition~\ref{P:twist}, none of these
curves is mod~$13$ congruent to a quadratic twist of another of them
(including itself); the same is true for the curves and values of~$p$
in case~(v). Thus no examples arise in cases (iv) and (v).

The remaining case~(iii) includes the infinitely many curves with
$\rhobar_{E,13}$ reducible (recall that $X_0(13)$ has genus~0). In
spite of the lack of helpful bounds as mentioned above, a congruence
between such curves will often be addressed by local methods in
practice. Indeed, the bounds are very large as they depend on
Tchebotarev density theorem to predict a prime~$\ell$ of good
reduction for~$E$ where Frobenius has order multiple of~$p$; however,
in practice, it is usually easy to find such a prime~$\ell$ after
trying a few small primes.  There are no reducible mod~$13$ congruences in the LMFDB database, so instead we refer to \cite[Example~31.2]{FKSym} for
an example with $p=7$ analogous to the discussion in this paragraph.

\section{Congruences between Twists}

Congruences between elliptic curves which are twists of each other arise in a number of ways in our study; in this section we look into this situation in detail.

Let $p$ be an odd prime. Let $D_{n}$ denote the dihedral group
with~$2n$ elements and $C_n \subset D_{n}$ for a normal cyclic
subgroup of order~$n$; note that $C_n$ is unique unless $n=2$, in
which case $D_{n} \simeq C_2 \times C_2$ and there are three such
subgroups.  We will also denote by $C \subset \GL_2(\F_p)$ a Cartan
subgroup (either split or non-split) and by $N$ its normalizer in
$\GL_2(\F_p)$.  


%{\bf In what follows we will use standard facts about
%subgroups of $\GL_2(\F_p)$ and $\PGL_2(\F_p)$: see, for example,
%\cite[Theorem XI.2.3]{LangModForms}.}

Let $K$ be a number field and $E/K$ an elliptic curve. If the
representation $\rhobar_{E,p}$ has image contained in $N \subset
\GL_2(\F_p)$ but not in the Cartan subgroup~$C$, then the projective
image $\PP \rhobar_{E,p}(G_K)$ is~$D_{n}$ for some~$n$ (see, for example, \cite[Theorem XI.2.3]{LangModForms}). Then there is
a quadratic extension~$M = K(\sqrt{d})$ corresponding to a
subgroup~$C_n$ as above, i.e. $\PP \rhobar_{E,p}(G_M) \simeq C_n$. 
We will see in Proposition~\ref{P:twist} below that in this setting there is a 
mod~$p$ congruence between~$E$ and its quadratic twist by~$d$. 
This kind construction is the main source of congruences between twisted curves 
and it appeared already in~??; our main objective in this context is then to describe the symplectic type of such congruences (see Theorem~\ref{T:quadratic}). There are also congruences between curves which are higher order twists of each other and we describe them in Theorems~?? and respective symplectic types in~??.

\subsection{Twists of elliptic curves}

Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over any field~$K$ of
characteristic~$0$, and let $G_K$ denote as usual the absolute Galois
group of~$K$.  For $a, b \in K$, we write $E_{a,b}$ for the elliptic
curve defined over~$K$ by the short Weierstrass equation
$Y^2=X^3+aX+b$; every elliptic curve over~$K$ has such a model, unique
up to replacing $(a,b)$ by~$(au^4,bu^6)$ with $u\in K^*$.

The twists of $E$ over $K$ are parametrized by $H^1(G_K,\Aut(E))$.  If
$E'$ is a twist of~$E$, then by definition there exists an isomorphism
$t:E\to E'$ defined over $\Kbar$, so that for $\sigma\in G_K$ we have
$t^{\sigma}=\psi(\sigma)t$ (that is,
$t(P)^{\sigma}=\psi(\sigma)t(P^\sigma)$ for all $P\in E(\Kbar)$) for
some cocycle~$\psi:G_K\to\Aut(E')\cong\Aut(E)$.  Here,
$\Aut(E)\cong\mu_n$ is cyclic of order~$n=2$, $4$ or $6$ according as
$j(E)\not\in\{0,1728\}$, $j(E)=1728$ and $j(E)=0$ respectively.  By
Kummer theory, $H^1(G_K,\Aut(E))\cong H^1(G_K,\mu_n)\cong
K^*/(K^*)^n$.

In the cases where $\Aut(E)\not=\{\pm1\}$, we make two seemingly
trivial, but important, observations. First, $G_K$ acts non-trivially
on~$\Aut(E)$, unless $-1$ or $-3$ (respectively for the cases $n=4$
and $n=6$) are squares in~$K$, so the cocycle is not a homomorphism;
secondly, there are \emph{two} isomorphisms
$\calO=\Z[\zeta_n]\cong\End(E)$ (differing by complex conjugation in
$\calO$), when $n=4$ or~$6$, and hence two actions of
$\calO^*\cong\Aut(E)$ on~$E$.

\subsubsection{$j\not=0,1728$}
In this case $\Aut(E)=\Aut(E')=\{\pm1\}$, with trivial Galois
action. The cocycle~$\psi$ is simply the quadratic character
$\psi:G_K\to\{\pm1\}$ associated to a quadratic extension
$K(\sqrt{d})/K$ for some $d\in K^*/(K^*)^2$, in accordance with the
Kummer isomorphism $H^1(G_K,\Aut(E))\cong K^*/(K^*)^2$.  The twist
of~$E$ by $d$ is denoted $E^d$ and is called a \emph{quadratic twist}.
A model for $E^d$ when , and we have a bijection between the set of
quadratic twists of~$E$ and the nontrivial elements
of~$K^*/(K^*)^2$. An isomorphism $E_{a,b}\to E_{ad^2,bd^3}$ defined
over~$K(\sqrt{d})$ is given by $(x,y) \mapsto (dx,d\sqrt{d}y)$

\subsubsection{$j=1728$}
Now $\End(E)\cong\calO=\Z[\zeta_4]$ and
$\Aut(E)\cong\calO^*\cong\mu_4$ as Galois modules.  The twists of $E$
are parametrized by $H^1(G_K,\mu_4)\cong K^*/(K^*)^4$ and are called
\emph{quartic twists}.  The curve~$E$ has a model~$E=E_{a,0}$, and its
twist by~$u\in K^*$ is $E_{au,0}$, which is isomorphic to~$E_{a,0}$ if
and only if $u\in (K^*)^4$.

We fix isomorphisms $\calO\cong\End(E)$ and $\calO\cong\End(E')$, and
hence isomorphisms $\mu_4=\calO^*\cong\Aut(E)\cong\Aut(E')$, which are
normalised (in the sense of \cite[Prop.~I.1.1]{SilvermanII}), so that
$\zeta\cdot t(P)=t(\zeta\cdot P)$ for $P\in E(\Kbar)$ and
$\zeta\in\calO^*$. Then the twist isomorphism~$t$ is an isomorphism
of~$\calO$-modules, and we may view the twisting cocycle~$\psi$ as
taking values in~$\calO^*$, given by $\psi(\sigma) =
\sigma(u^{1/4})/u^{1/4} \in \mu_4$.

An isomorphism $t:E_{a,0}\to E_{au,0}$ is given by
$(x,y)\mapsto(v^2x,v^3y)$ for some fixed choice of
$v=u^{1/4}\in\Kbar$, and a normalised action of $\zeta\in\mu_4$ is
given by $(x,y)\mapsto(\zeta^2x,\zeta^3y)$ on both $E_{a,0}$
and~$E_{au,0}$.  We have $t^\sigma = \psi(\sigma)t = t\psi(\sigma)$
for all $\sigma\in G_K$.

As a special case, when $u=d^2\in(K^*)^2$, with $\pm d\notin(K^*)^2$,
the quartic twist by~$u$ is the same as the quadratic twist by~$d$.
These are just the quartic twists for which the cocycle takes values
in $\{\pm1\}$.  For what follows it is important to note the
following: for elliptic curves with $j$-invariant~$1728$, the
quadratic twists by~$+d$ and by~$-d$ are exactly the same, and in
particular the twist by~$-1$ is trivial.  This is simplest to see from
the explicit model $E_{ad^2,0}$ for the twisted curve, which only
involves~$d^2$.  When $-1$ is a square in~$K$ then it is obvious that
the quadratic twist by~$-1$ is trivial, but this is also true when
$K(\sqrt{-1})\not=K$.  A more intrinsic explanation of this fact is
that the inflation map $H^1(G_K,\mu_2)\to H^1(G_K,\mu_4)$ is not
injective, but has kernel of order~$2$, when $-1$ is not a square
in~$K$.  This is most easily seen using the Kummer isomorphism, under
which the inflation map becomes the squaring map $K^*/(K^*)^2 \to
K^*/(K^*)^4$, which has $-1$ in its kernel.  Thus, when $j(E)=1728$,
the quadratic twists of~$E$ are parametrized not by $K^*/(K^*)^2$ but
by $K^*/\left<-1,(K^*)^2\right>$.

\begin{remark}\label{R:2-isog}
The quartic twist by~$u=-4$ is trivial if and only if $-1$ is a square
in~$K$, since $-4=(1+\sqrt{-1})^4$.  The curves $E_{a,0}$
and~$E_{-4a,0}$ are $2$-isogenous over~$K$ (see
\cite[p. 336]{SilvermanI}); over $K(\sqrt{-1})$ this $2$-isogeny is
the endomorphism $1+\sqrt{-1}$.  Note that this twist is \emph{not} a
quadratic twist, despite the fact that the curve and its twist become
isomorphic over a quadratic extension.  Taking $v=1+\sqrt{-1}$ so that
$v^4=-4$, the cocycle~$\psi$ takes value
$\psi(\sigma)=\sigma(1+\sqrt{-1})/(1+\sqrt{-1})=-\sqrt{-1}$ when
$\sigma$ does not fix~$\sqrt{-1}$.
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{$j=0$}
Now $\End(E)\cong\calO=\Z[\zeta_6]$ and
$\Aut(E)\cong\calO^*\cong\mu_6$ as Galois modules.  The twists of $E$
parametrized by $H^1(G_K,\mu_6)\cong K^*/(K^*)^6$ and are called
\emph{sextic twists}.  The curve~$E$ has a model~$E=E_{0,b}$, and its
twist by~$u\in K^*$ is $E_{0,bu}$, which is isomorphic to~$E_{0,b}$ if
and only if $u\in (K^*)^6$.

Again we fix normalised isomorphisms $\calO\cong\End(E)\cong\End(E')$
and hence isomorphisms $\mu_6=\calO^*\cong\Aut(E)\cong\Aut(E')$ so
that again, $\zeta\cdot t(P)=t(\zeta\cdot P)$ for $P\in E(\Kbar)$ and
$\zeta\in\calO^*$.  The cocycle is given by $\psi(\sigma) =
\sigma(u^{1/6})/u^{1/6} \in \mu_6$.

An isomorphism $t:E_{0,b}\to E_{0,bu}$ is given by
$(x,y)\mapsto(v^2x,v^3y)$ for some fixed choice of
$v=u^{1/6}\in\Kbar$, and a normalised action of $\zeta\in\mu_6$ is
given by $(x,y)\mapsto(\zeta^2x,\zeta^3y)$ on both $E_{0,b}$
and~$E_{0,bu}$.  Again we have $t^\sigma = \psi(\sigma)t =
t\psi(\sigma)$ for all $\sigma\in G_K$.

As a special case, when $u=d^3\in(K^*)^3$, with $d\notin(K^*)^2$, we
again obtain the quadratic twist by~$d$ as a special case of a sextic
twist.  Again, these are just the sextic twists for which the cocycle
takes values in $\{\pm1\}$.  Unlike the case of $j(E)=1728$ we obtain
each quadratic twist exactly once, since the inflation map
$H^1(G_K,\mu_2)\to H^1(G_K,\mu_6)$ is now injective, as is the cubing
map $K^*/(K^*)^2 \to K^*/(K^*)^6$.

\begin{remark}\label{R:3-isog}
The sextic twist by~$u=-27$ is the quadratic twist by~$-3$, and is
trivial if and only if $-3$ is a square in~$K$.  The curves $E_{0,b}$
and~$E_{0,-27b}$ are $3$-isogenous over~$K$; over $K(\sqrt{-3})$ this
$3$-isogeny is the endomorphism $\sqrt{-3}$.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}\label{L:twist-rep}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
  Let $E$ and $E^d$ be quadratic twists defined over~$K$, and let
  $\eps_d$ denote the associated quadratic character of~$G_K$.  Then
  there is an isomorphism $t :E\to E^d$ defined over $K(\sqrt{d})$
  satisfying
\begin{equation}\label{E:iso-twist}
t (\sigma(P)) = \eps_d(\sigma)\sigma(t (P))\qquad\text{for
  all~$\sigma\in G_K$ and $P\in E(\Kbar)$};
\end{equation}
that is, $t ^{\sigma} = \eps_d(\sigma)t $.  For all primes~$p$ we have
\begin{equation} \label{E:rho-twist}
  \rhobar_{E^d,p} \cong \rhobar_{E,p}\otimes\eps_d.
\end{equation}
\item More generally, when $E'$ is the twist of~$E$ by a
  cocycle~$\psi$, there is an isomorphism $t :E\to E'$ defined
  over an extension of $K$ of degree at most~$6$, satisfying
  \begin{equation}\label{E:iso-twist-general}
t (\sigma(P)) = \psi(\sigma)\sigma(t (P)) =
\sigma(t (P))\psi(\sigma)\qquad\text{for all~$\sigma\in G_K$ and
  $P\in E(\Kbar)$};
  \end{equation}
  that is, $t ^{\sigma} = \psi(\sigma)t $.

  There is no simple relation of the form~(\ref{E:rho-twist}) when the
twist is not quadratic.
  \end{enumerate}

\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}
Equations (\ref{E:iso-twist}) and (\ref{E:iso-twist-general}) were
given above.  Relation (\ref{E:rho-twist}) follows immediately from
(\ref{E:iso-twist}).  In the case of non-quadratic twists, the
representation attached to $E'$ is not a character twist of that
attached to~$E$ and no analogue of (\ref{E:rho-twist}) holds.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Projectively dihedral images}
Recall that our final objective is to classify the symplectic type of congruences between twists. Clearly this only makes sense if the $p$-torsion modules of the relevant curves do not admit anti-symplectic automorphisms. 

Given an elliptic curve~$E$ over a number field~$K$ and and odd prime~$p$ we say 
that~$E[p]$ satisfies condition~{\bf (S)} if $E[p]$ does not admit anti-symplectic automorphisms. The following proposition follows from~\cite{FKSym} and gives an equivalent description of condition~{\bf (S)}.

\begin{proposition} \label{P:conditionS}
Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over a number field~$K$. Let~$p > 2$ be a prime and $\rhobar_{E,p} : G_K \to \GL_2(\F_p)$ the representation arising from the action of~$G_K$ on $E[p]$. 

Then $E[p]$ satisfies condition~{\bf (S)} if and only if one of the following is satisfied:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item[(A)] The image of $\rhobar_{E,p}$ is a non-abelian subgroup of~$\GL_2(\F_p)$ or,
 \item[(B)] we have $\rhobar_{E,p} \cong \left( \begin{smallmatrix} \chi & * \\ 0 & \chi \end{smallmatrix} \right)$ where $\chi : G_K \to \F_p^*$ is a character
 and $* \neq 0$.
 \end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

{\bf The previous proposition and discussion might make more sense in the introduction}


Note that if $\rhobar_{E,p}$ is absolutely irreducible then $E[p]$ satisfies condition~{\bf (S)} because it satifies 
condition~(A) in Proposition~\ref{P:conditionS}. Conversely, the next result shows that, in the presence of a $p$-congruence between twists, condition~{\bf (S)} implies that
$\rhobar_{E,p}$ is absolutely irreducible.

\begin{lemma} \label{L:noCyclic}
Let $E/K$ be an elliptic curve and $p \geq 5$ a prime. Suppose that~$E[p]$ satisfies condition~{\bf (S)}. 
If $E$ is $p$-congruent to a twist~$E'$ then $\rhobar_{E,p}$ is absolutely irreducible.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
For a contradiction, suppose $\rhobar_{E,p}$ is absolutely reducible. Thus
\begin{equation} \label{E:absRed}
  \rhobar_{E,p} \otimes \Fbar_p \cong 
 \begin{pmatrix}
 \chi_1 & h \\ 0 &\chi_2
 \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{ with } \; h \neq 0, 
\end{equation} 
where $h \neq 0$ follows from 
the description of the two cases
in Proposition~\ref{P:conditionS}.

Also, since $p > 3$, we conclude that $j(E) \neq 0, 1728$, 
otherwise $E$ has CM by~$\Q(i)$ or $\Q(\sqrt{-3})$ and the image would be in the normalizer of a Cartan. Therefore $E$ only admits quadratic twists and we have $E' = E^d$ for some square-free $d \in K$.

Let $\eps_d$ be the quadratic character associated to the extension
$K(\sqrt{d})/K$. From 
the hypothesis  
$E[p] \simeq E^d[p]$, 
part 1) of Lemma~\ref{L:twist-rep}
and~\eqref{E:absRed} it follows that
$\chi_1 =\chi_1\eps_d$
since both give the Galois action on the unique fixed line. This contradicts ~$\eps_d \neq 1$.
\end{proof}

The following is a direct consequence of the previous proof, showing that the previous lemma also holds for $p=3$ in most cases.

\begin{corollary}\label{C:noCyclic}
 Let $E/K$ be an elliptic curve with $j(E) \neq 0$. Let $p \geq 3$ be a prime.
Assume $E[p]$ satisfies condition~{\bf (S)} and is $p$-congruent to a twist. Then~$\rhobar_{E,p}$ is absolutely irreducibile.
\end{corollary}

Under the natural condition~{\bf (S)}, the 
previous lemma tells us we can assume
that $\rhobar_{E,p}$ is absolutely irreducible for our study. In fact more is true:
in the next proposition we show that congruences between 
twists arise when the projective image is dihedral of order at least~4; equivalently
(except when the image is very small or reducible), when the image is
contained in the normaliser of a Cartan subgroup but not in the Cartan
itself.

\begin{comment}
In the rest of this section we will study elliptic curves whose
mod~$p$ representations are projectively dihedral: that is, such that
$\PP \rhobar_{E,p} (G_K) \simeq D_{n}$.  This includes, but is not
restricted to, curves with CM where the extra endomorphisms are not
defined over the ground field.  In the following two subsections we
specialise to the case of curves CM by $\Z[\zeta_4]$ and $\Z[\zeta_6]$
where quartic and sextic twists are possible.  In this subsection we
restrict to quadratic twists, together with the special quartic twist
(see Remark~\ref{R:2-isog}) which becomes trivial over a quadratic
extension.

When $\PP \rhobar_{E,p} (G_K) \simeq D_{n}$, let~$K(\sqrt{d})$ be the
quadratic extension cut out by a cyclic subgroup~$C_n<D_n$ of
index~$2$.  This cyclic subgroup is unique, except when $n=2$ when
there are three possibilities for~$C_2<D_2\cong C_2\times C_2$, and
hence for $K(\sqrt{d})$. In this situation, we will see that
$E[p]\cong E^d[p]$ as $G_K$-modules, and we will determine the
symplectic type of this isomorphism.  This is in accordance with
Theorem~\ref{T:constraint}, since in passing from $K$
to~$K(\sqrt{d})$, the projective image becomes cyclic and hence
(absolutely) reducible.

First we exclude some degenerate cases, where the projective image is
very small, in which case this symplectic type is not well-defined.

\begin{lemma}\label{L:irred}
Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over the number field~$K$, let $p$ be an
odd prime, and suppose that we have a congruence $E[p]\cong E^d[p]$
for some quadratic twist~$E^d$ of~$E$.  If the projective image $\PP
\rhobar_{E,p} (G_K)$ has size at least~$3$ then $E[p]$ is absolutely
irreducible.
\end{lemma}
\textbf{I added ``absolutely'' in the statement and adjusted the proof
accordingly.  Please check whether you agree!}
\begin{proof}
Let $\eps$ be the quadratic character associated to the extension
$K(\sqrt{d})/K$.  Suppose that $V:=E[p]\otimes_{\F_p}\F_{p^2}$ is
reducible.  If $V$ has at least two fixed lines, then $\rhobar_{E,p}$
has the form \(
\begin{pmatrix}\chi_1&0\\0&\chi_2
\end{pmatrix}
\) (over~$\F_{p^2}$) for two characters~$\chi_1$, $\chi_2$, and by
hypothesis, using~(\ref{E:rho-twist}), we have
\[
\begin{pmatrix}\chi_1&0\\0&\chi_2
\end{pmatrix}
\sim
\begin{pmatrix}\chi_1\eps&0\\0&\chi_2\eps
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
The projective image is trivial if $\chi_1=\chi_2$.  Otherwise, since
$\eps$ is not trivial, this equivalence implies $\chi_1=\chi_2\eps$,
so the projective image has order~$2$.

If $V$ has exactly one fixed line then $\rhobar_{E,p}$ has the form \(
\begin{pmatrix}\chi_1&h\\0&\chi_2
\end{pmatrix}
\)
with $h\not=0$, and
\[
\begin{pmatrix}\chi_1&h\\0&\chi_2
\end{pmatrix}
\sim
\begin{pmatrix}\chi_1\eps&h\eps\\0&\chi_2\eps
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
This yields a contradiction, since $\chi_1\not=\chi_1\eps$ but both
give the Galois action on the fixed line.

Hence reducibility of~$E[p]\otimes_{\F_p}\F_{p^2}$, together with
$E[p]\cong E^d[p]$, implies that the projective image has order at
most~$2$.
\end{proof}

When the projective image is~$D_n$ with $n\ge2$, it is often the case
that the image is contained in the normaliser~$N$ of a Cartan
subgroup~$C$ of~$\GL_2(\F_p)$.  For $n=2$, the projective image
is~$D_2\cong C_2\times C_2$, and there are there are three different
choices for~$C$ for which this holds, while for $n\ge3$ the Cartan
subgroup is unique.  The image may be dihedral in other ways, for
example $\left\{\begin{pmatrix}\pm1&*\\0&1\end{pmatrix}\right\}$, but
this is reducible so by the previous lemma does not give rise to a
congruent quadratic twist.
\end{comment}

\begin{proposition}\label{P:twist}
Let $E/K$ be an elliptic curve and $p \geq 5$ a prime. Suppose that~$E[p]$ satisfies condition~{\bf (S)}. 

1) If $E$ is $p$-congruent to a twist, 
then the image of~$\rhobar_{E,p}$ is contained in the normaliser of a
Cartan subgroup of $\GL_2(\F_p)$ but not in the Cartan itself and
$\PP \rhobar_{E,p} \simeq D_n$ for some $n \geq 2$.

2) Conversely, if the image of~$\rhobar_{E,p}$ is absolutely irreducible and contained in the
normaliser of a Cartan subgroup of $\GL_2(\F_p)$ but not in the Cartan
subgroup itself, 
then we have $E[p]\cong E'[p]$ where $E'$ is the twist associated to
the quadratic extension~$K(\sqrt{d})$ cut out by the Cartan subgroup.
This is the quadratic twist~$E^d$ unless $j(E)=1728$ and $d=-1$ in
which case it is the quartic twist by~$-4$.

Moreover, there is a unique twist with this property, except when the
projective image has order~$4$, in which case there are three such
twists.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof} 1) Let $E'$ be a $p$-congruent twist of~$E$. If $E'$ is a quartic or sextic twist of~$E$ then $j(E)=0,1728$ and 
$E$ has CM by $\Q(\sqrt{-1})$ or $\Q(\sqrt{-3})$; moreover, since $p > 3$ the image is well known to be irreducible and projectively isomorphic to $D_n$ for $n \geq 2$. 

Therefore we can assume $E' = E^d$ 
is the quadratic twist of~$E$ by a square-free $d\in K$.
From Lemma~\ref{L:noCyclic} we know that~$\rhobar_{E,p}$ is absolutely irreducible. 

Let $\eps_d$ be the quadratic character of $G_K$ associated to the
extension $K(\sqrt{d})/K$. By (\ref{E:rho-twist}), for primes~$\frq$
of~$K$ where both curves have good reduction (so excluding only
finitely many primes), we have
\[
  a_\frq(E^d) = \eps_d(\frq) a_\frq(E),
\]
where $a_\frq(E)$ and $a_\frq(E^d)$ denotes the trace of Frobenius at
$\frq$ of~$E$ and~$E^d$, respectively, and we view $\eps_d$ as a
function on primes of~$K$ unramified in~$K(\sqrt{d})$ as usual via
class field theory.
  
Moreover, since $E^d[p]\cong
  E[p]$, we have
  \[
  a_\frq(E^d) \equiv a_\frq(E) \pmod{p}.
  \]
  Hence for almost all primes~$\frq$ satisfying $\eps_d(\frq) = -1$ (i.e. inert
  in~$K(\sqrt{d})/K$) we have
  \[
  a_\frq(E^d) \equiv a_\frq(E) \equiv0 \pmod{p}.
  \]
  So the image $H=\rhobar_{E,p}(G_K)$ has a
  subgroup~$H^+=\rhobar_{E,p}(G_{K(\sqrt{d})})$ of index~$2$ such that
  all elements of~$H\setminus H^+$ have trace~$0$;  such elements have
  order~$2$ in $\PGL_2(\F_p)$. From the
  irreducibility of~$E[p]$ and the classification of subgroups of $\PGL_2(\F_p)$ (\cite[Theorem XI.2.3]{LangModForms}), it follows that $H$ is contained in the
  normaliser of a Cartan subgroup~$C$ and $H^+=H\cap C$.

2) For the converse, suppose that $\rhobar_{E,p}$ is absolutely irreducible and has image contained in
the normalizer $N \subset \GL_2(\F_p)$ of a Cartan subgroup~$C$, but
is not contained in~$C$ itself. Then $\Tr \rhobar_{E,p}(\sigma) = 0$
for all $\sigma \in G_K$ such that $\rhobar_{E,p}(\sigma) \not\in C$.

Let $K(\sqrt{d})$ be the quadratic extension cut out
by~$\rhobar_{E,p}^{-1}(C)$, with associated character $\eps_d$ as
above.  First suppose that we are not in the special case where
$j(E)=1728$ and $K(\sqrt{d})=K(\sqrt{-1})$.  Set $E'=E^d$, the
quadratic twist.  By~(\ref{E:rho-twist}), for all $\sigma \in G_K$ we
have the following equality of traces
\[\Tr \rhobar_{{E^d},p}(\sigma) = \eps_d(\sigma) \cdot \Tr \rhobar_{E,p}(\sigma).\]

Clearly, if $\eps_d(\sigma)=1$ then $\Tr \rhobar_{E,p}(\sigma) = \Tr \rhobar_{E^d,p}(\sigma)$. 
If $\eps(\sigma) = -1$ then $\rhobar_{E,p}(\sigma) \in \rhobar_{E,p} (G_K) \backslash C$ and $\Tr \rhobar_{E,p}(\sigma) = 0$, so also $\Tr \rhobar_{E^d,p}(\sigma) = 0$.
Then, $\Tr \rhobar_{E,p}(\sigma) = \Tr \rhobar_{E^d,p}(\sigma)$ 
for all $\sigma \in G_K$. 
Since $\rhobar_{E,p}$ and $\rhobar_{E^d,p}$ are absolutely irreducible
and have the same traces, they are isomorphic.

In the special case,  $E'$ is the quartic twist of~$E$ by~$-4$, since
these become isomorphic over~$K(\sqrt{-1})$
({\bf why?}). 
Now $E$ and~$E'$ are
isogenous, so are $p$-congruent for all odd~$p$.

For the last part, we note that $D_2\cong C_2\times C_2$ has three
cyclic subgroups of index~$2$, while $D_n$ for $n\ge3$ has only one
such subgroup.
\end{proof}


A special case of the situation described in this result is the case
of elliptic curves with~CM.  Here, the quadratic twists are isogenous
to the original curve so we may already determine the symplectic nature
of the congruence.  For simplicity we state this result over~$\Q$.

\begin{corollary}\label{C:CM-twist}
  Let $E/\Q$ be an elliptic curve with CM by the imaginary quadratic
  order of (negative) discriminant~$-D$.  Set $M=\Q(\sqrt{-D})$.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    For $D\not=4$: $E[p] \simeq E^{-D}[p]$ for all primes $p \geq 5$
    unramified in~$M$ and of good reduction for~$E$.  This congruence
    is symplectic if and only if $\legendre{D}{p}=+1$.  For each
    such~$p$, $E^{-D}$ is the unique quadratic twist of~$E$
    which is $p$-congruent to~$E$.

  \item
    For $D=4$: let $E'$ be the quartic twist of~$E$ by~$-4$, so that
    $E$ and $E'$ are isomorphic over~$M$ but not over~$\Q$.  Again,
    $E[p] \simeq E'[p]$ for all primes $p \geq 5$ unramified in~$M$
    and of good reduction for~$E$.  This congruence is symplectic if
    and only if $\legendre{2}{p}=+1$.  For each such~$p$, there are no
    quadratic twists of~$E$ which are $p$-congruent to~$E$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Since $E$ has CM by~$M$ we know that the image of~$\rhobar_{E,p}$ is
the normalizer of a Cartan for all primes $p$ unramified in~$M$ and of
good reduction for~$E$.  Moreover, $\PP \rhobar_{E,p} \simeq D_n \neq
C_2 \times C_2$ (since $p \geq 5$) and $\PP \rhobar_{E,p}(G_M) \simeq
C_n$. Thus, for each such~$p$, in the notation of
Proposition~\ref{P:twist}, we have $K(\sqrt{d})=M$, so $E[p]\cong
E^{-D}[p]$ except for $D=4$ when $E[p]\cong E'[p]$ for the
$-4$-quartic twist~$E'$.  Since the projective image is not~$C_2\times
C_2$, in each case there are no more $p$-congruences with curves
isomorphic to~$E$ over quadratic extensions.

For the symplectic types, observe that $E$ and~$E'$ are isogenous via
an isogeny of degree~$2$ for $D=4$ (see Remark~\ref{R:2-isog}), while
for $D\not=4$, one may check that $E$ and~$E^{-D}$ are isogenous via
an isogeny of degree $D/4$ for $D=8,12,16$, and~$28$ and of degree $D$
otherwise ({\bf why?}).  
%In all cases this isogeny becomes an endomorphism after base-change to~$M$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
In our computed data in Section~\ref{S:statistics}, we do not see
usually isomorphisms arising from CM curves as in this corollary. This
is because (apart from the CM cases where quartic or sextic twists
occur) all such mod~$p$ isomorphisms occur within an isogeny class,
and we have omitted these from consideration.
\end{remark}



Note that if $\PP\rhobar_{E,p} (G_K)$ has order~$1$ or~$2$, then the image
$\rhobar_{E,p} (G_K)$ is cyclic of order dividing~$2(p-1)$ and so not absolutely irreducible. In particular, the smallest projective images occurring in our context 
are $\rhobar_{E,p} (G_K) \simeq D_2 \simeq C_2 \times C_2$. The next result will be useful in Section~\ref{S:type} when determining the symplectic type of congruences in the presence of this kind of image.

\begin{lemma}\label{L:C2xC2}
Let $p$ be an odd prime.  Let $N$ be a subgroup of~$\PGL_2(\F_p)$
isomorphic to $C_2\times C_2$, so that there are three subgroups~$C< N$
of index~$2$.

If $N\le\PSL_2(\F_p)$, then every such~$C$ is contained in a Cartan
subgroup and $N$ in its normalizer, and each~$C$ is split when
$p\equiv1\pmod4$ and non-split when $p\equiv3\pmod4$.

If $N\not\le\PSL_2(\F_p)$, then for $p\equiv1\pmod4$, one such
subgroup~$C$ is contained in a split Cartan subgroup while the other
two are contained in non-split Cartan subgroups; while if
$p\equiv3\pmod4$ then one~$C$ is non-split and the other two are
split.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  First note that in~$\PGL_2(\F_p)$, the condition of having zero
  trace is well-defined, and the determinant is also well-defined
  modulo squares.  Also, $\PSL_2(\F_p)$ is the subgroup of~$\PGL_2(\F_p)$ of elements with
  square determinant, which has index~$2$.  Hence either
  $N\le\PSL_2(\F_p)$, and all elements of~$N$ have square determinant,
  or $[N:N\cap\PSL_2(\F_p)]=2$, in which case exactly one of the
  elements of order~$2$ has square determinant.

  Examination of the characteristic polynomial shows that the elements
  of order~$2$ in~$\PGL_2(\F_p)$ are precisely those with trace zero,
  and these elements are split (having $2$ fixed points on
  $\PP^1(\F_p)$) if the determinant is minus a square, and non-split
  (having no fixed points) otherwise.  Hence when $p\equiv1\pmod4$,
  elements of order~$2$ are split if and only if they lie in
  $\PSL_2(\F_p)$, while for $p\equiv3\pmod4$ the reverse is the case.
  The result follows.
\end{proof}


\begin{comment}
Explanation of the isogeny degree:  we look for an element of the
order which is primitive (not divisible within the order by any
integer >1) so that the kernel is cyclic, and on which Galois acts as
it does on the twist isomorphism.  Apart from D=4 the latter
con-diction means that the element must be pure imaginary, which
uniquely determines it up to sign.  For D=4 we need a primitive
element of Z[i] whose conjugate is misapplied by i or -i.

D = 4: 1+i, norm 2
D = 16: 2i, norm 4

D = 8: Surat{-2}, norm 2

D = 3 and 12: Surat{-3}, norm 3
D = 27: 3*sqrt{-3}, norm 27

D = 7 and 28: sqrt{-7], norm 7

D = p = 11, 19, 43, 67, 163: sqrt{-p}, norm p

The fact of 4 for D=16,8,12,28 does not affect the Legendre symbol but
the factor of 2 for D=4 does!

\begin{comment}
\begin{theorem} \label{T:Cartan}
Let $p$ be an odd prime. Let $E/K$ be an elliptic curve such that
$\rhobar_{E,p}$ has projective image of order greater than~$2$, and
suppose that for some quadratic twist~$E^d$ we have a congruence
$E[p]\cong E^d[p]$.
\begin{enumerate}
%% \item In the case of the special quadratic twist, the congruence is
%%   symplectic if and only if $(2/p)=+1$.

\item Let $C$ be the Cartan subgroup of~$\GL_2(\F_p)$
  associated to the extension $K(\sqrt{d})/K$ in
  Proposition~\ref{P:twist}.  Then the congruence is symplectic if and
  only if \emph{either} $C$ is split and $p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$,
  \emph{or} $C$ is non-split and $p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$.

\item When $\PP\rhobar_{E,p}\cong C_2\times C_2$, there are three
  different quadratic\footnote{as above, when $j(E)=1728$ one of these
    is the quartic twist by~$-4$ so not in fact quadratic.}  twists
    of~$E$ which are $p$-congruent to~$E$.  If $\sqrt{p^*}\in K$ then
    all three congruences are symplectic.  Otherwise, one of the
    quadratic twists is by $K(\sqrt{p^*})$ and is symplectic while the
    other two are anti-symplectic.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
%% (1) In this case we know by Remark~\ref{R:2-isog} that $E^{-1}$ is
%%   $2$-isogenous to~$E$, so the result follows by the isogeny
%%   criterion.  Assume from now on that this is not the case.

(1) As usual, write $\eps_d$ for the quadratic character of~$G_K$
  fixing~$K(\sqrt{d})$.  By Lemma~\ref{L:twist-rep}, there exists an
  isomorphism~$\alpha: E \to E^d$ satisfying~(\ref{E:iso-twist}).  Let
  $t: E[p](\Qbar) \to E^d[p](\Qbar)$ denote the induced map on
  $p$-torsion points; this is an $\F_p$-linear isomorphism but is not
  Galois equivariant: in fact, (\ref{E:iso-twist}) implies that
\begin{equation} \label{E:eps}
 t(\sigma(P)) = \eps_d(\sigma)\cdot\sigma(t(P)) \quad \text{ for all } \sigma \in G_K
 \text{ and all } P \in E[p].
\end{equation}
Since $\alpha$ is an isomorphism over~$\Qbar$, $t$ preserves the Weil
pairing.

Let $\delta\in\F_p^*$ be a fixed square if the Cartan subgroup~$C$ is
split, and a fixed non-square if it is non-split.  We shall define a
map~$s:E[p]\to E[p]$ satisfying
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $s$ is an~$\F_p$-linear isomorphism;
  \item  $s(\sigma(P)) = \eps_d(\sigma)\cdot\sigma(s(P)) \quad \text{ for all } \sigma \in G_K
    \text{ and all } P \in E[p]$; 
  \item $e_p(s(P),s(Q)) = e_p(P,Q)^{-\delta}$ for all $P,Q\in E[p]$.
\end{enumerate}
Note that~(2) is identical to property~(\ref{E:eps}) satisfied
by~$t$. Thus, given such an~$s$, the composite $t\circ s:E[p]\to
E^d[p]$ is a Galois equivariant isomorphism which by~(3) is symplectic
if and only if the Legendre symbol $(-\delta/p) = 1$ and
anti-symplectic otherwise. The result now follows by simple case
checking.

\def\rd{\sqrt{\delta}} Define the $2$-dimensional
$\F_p$-algebra~$A=\F_p[X]/(X^2-\delta)$.  Then $A\cong\F_p\oplus\F_p$
or $\F_{p^2}$ (as $\F_p$-algebras) in the split and non-split cases
respectively.  We write $\sqrt{\delta}$ for the image of~$X$ in~$A$,
which is a generator of~$A$ as $A$-algebra; note that in the split
case $\rd$ does not refer to a square root of~$\delta$ in~$\F_p$.
Denote by $x\mapsto\overline{x}$ the nontrivial automorphism of~$A$,
mapping $\rd$ to $-\rd$.

The Cartan subgroup~$C$ may be identified with the group of
units~$A^{\times}$, and hence with the group of $A$-linear
automorphisms of~$A$: these are maps~$f$ of the form $x\mapsto ax$ for
some $a\in A^{\times}$.  Similarly, $N$ is identified with the group
of semi-linear automorphisms of~$A$; explicitly, elements of
$N\setminus C$ correspond to conjugate-linear maps $A\to A$,
\textit{i.e.}, maps~$f$ of the form $x\mapsto a\overline{x}$ for
some~$a\in A^{\times}$.

From the hypothesis on the image of $\rhobar_{E,p}$, we may identify
$A$ with~$E[p]$ in such a way that, for $\sigma\in G_K$, if
$\eps_d(\sigma)=+1$ so that $\rhobar_{E,p}(\sigma)\in C$, the induced
action of~$\sigma$ on~$A$ is linear, while if $\eps_d(\sigma)=-1$ so
that $\rhobar_{E,p}(\sigma)\in N\setminus C$, the induced action
of~$\sigma$ on~$A$ is conjugate linear.

Now let $s:E[p]\to E[p]$ be the map, which when considered as a map
$A\to A$ under this identification, is given by multiplication
by~$\rd$.  This is clearly $\F_p$-linear, and since linear maps
commute, we see that $s(\sigma(P))=\sigma(s(P))$
whenever~$\eps_d(\sigma)=+1$. Also, $\overline{\rd}=-\rd$ implies that
multiplication by~$\rd$ anticommutes with conjugate-linear maps, so
$s(\sigma(P))=-\sigma(s(P))$ whenever~$\eps_d(\sigma)=-1$.  Hence $s$
satisfies properties (1) and~(2).

Define $\left<\; , \right>:A\times A\to \mu_p$ to be the pairing which
under our identification $A\cong E[p]$ corresponds to the Weil
pairing.  This is $\F_p$-bilinear and alternating.  For all $x,y\in A$
and~$a\in A^{\times}$ we have $\left<ax,ay\right> =
\left<x,y\right>^{N(a)}$, where $N(a)=a\overline{a}$ is the norm map
from~$A$ to~$\F_p$.  This follows from the $\F_p$-linearity of
multiplication by~$a$, together with the facts that the pairing is
alternating and that (by definition) $N(a)$ is the determinant of
multiplication by~$a$.  Taking $a=\rd$ we have $N(\rd)=-\delta$, and we see
that $\left<\rd x,\rd y\right> = \left<x,y\right>^{-\delta}$, and
hence that $e_p(s(P),s(Q)) = e_p(P,Q)^{-\delta}$ for all $P,Q\in
E[p]$, as required.


(2) Since the determinant of $\rhobar_{E,p}$ is the mod~$p$ cyclotomic
character, we have $\PP\rhobar_{E,p}(G_K)\subseteq \PSL_2(\F_p)$ if
and only if $\sqrt{p^*}\in K$.  When this is the case, by
Lemma~\ref{L:C2xC2} we see that each index~$2$ subgroup of the
projective image is split when $p\equiv1\pmod4$ and each is non-split
when $p\equiv3\pmod4$.  By part (2), it follows in both cases that the
congruences between~$E$ and each of the three twists are all
symplectic.

Now suppose that $\sqrt{p^*}\notin K$.  By Lemma~\ref{L:C2xC2} again,
exactly one of the three subgroups is split when $p\equiv1\pmod4$, and
exactly one is non-split when $p\equiv3\pmod4$, so in both cases
exactly one congruence is symplectic.  Moreover, since the subgroup
$C$ inducing the symplectic congruence is the unique one contained in
$\PSL_2(\F_p)$, the associated quadratic extension is~$K(\sqrt{p^*})$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Restrictions on the image}
The following theorem is the main constraint on the existence of congruences between twists.

\begin{theorem} \label{T:constraint}
Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over a number field~$K$, and let
$E'$ be a twist of~$E$, isomorphic to $E$ over an extension $L/K$.
Suppose that for some prime $p>2$ there is a $p$-congruence
between~$E$ and~$E'$.

If $E[p]$ (and hence also $E'[p]$) 
is absolutely irreducible 
both as a
$G_K$-module and also as $G_L$-module, then the twist is trivial; that
is, $E$ and~$E'$ are isomorphic over~$K$ itself.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $t :E\to E'$ be an isomorphism defined over~$L$ satisfying
$t ^\sigma=\psi(\sigma)t $ as in Lemma~\ref{L:twist-rep},
where $\psi$ is a cocycle trivial on~$G_L$.  Let $t _p$ denote the
induced map $E[p]\to E'[p]$, which is $\F_p$-linear and also satisfies
the twist relation $t _p^\sigma=\psi(\sigma)t _p$, so
$t _p$ is $G_L$-equivariant.  We are also given a
$G_K$-equivariant isomorphism $\varphi:E[p]\to E'[p]$.  Since both
$t _p$ and~$\varphi$ are $G_L$-equivariant isomorphisms between
the absolutely irreducible $G_L$-modules $E[p]$ and~$E'[p]$, they
differ by a scalar, so there exists $n\in\F_p^*$ such that
$t _p=[n]\circ\varphi$.  (Here, $[n]$ denotes the multiplication
by~$n$ endomorphism of both $E[p]$ and $E'[p]$.)  But $[n]$ is
$G_K$-equivariant, hence so is $t _p$: that is, $t _p^\sigma =
t _p$ for all~$\sigma\in G_K$.

It remains to show that $t $ itself is $G_K$-equivariant;
equivalently, that $\psi$ is trivial.  For all $\sigma\in G_K$, we
have
\[
t _p = t _p^\sigma = \psi(\sigma)t _p \iff 
(1-\psi(\sigma)) \cdot t_p = 0
\]
so, since $t _p$ is an isomorphism, $\psi(\sigma)-1 = 0$ as an
endomorphism of~$E'[p]$.  Hence $p$ divides $\psi(\sigma)-1$ in
$\End(E')$.  This is only possible if $\psi(\sigma)=1$ for
all~$\sigma\in G_K$: for in $\End(E')\cong\calO=\Z[\zeta_n]$ with
$n=2$, $4$ or~$6$, for all $\zeta\in \calO^*$ except $\zeta=1$, the
element $\zeta-1$ is only divisible by~$2$ if $\zeta=-1$ and is not
divisible by any rational prime if $\zeta$ has order greater than~$2$.

Since $p > 2$ we conclude 
that $\psi$ is trivial, so $E\cong E'$ over~$K$ as required.
\end{proof}

We define the \emph{projective $p$-division field} $F$ of an elliptic
curve~$E$ defined over $K$ to be the fixed field of the kernel of the
projective representation~$\PP \rhobar_{E,p}$. 


Note that both the
irreducibility and absolute irreducibility of~$\rhobar_{E,p}$ only
depend on its projective image, since $\rhobar_{E,p}$ is irreducible if
and only if $\PP \rhobar_{E,p}$ has no fixed points in its action
through~$\PGL_2(\F_p)$ on~$\PP E[p]\cong\PP^1(\F_p)$, while
$\rhobar_{E,p}$is absolutely irreducible if and only if $\PP
\rhobar_{E,p}$ has no fixed points in its action
through~$\PGL_2(\F_p)\subset\PGL_2(\F_{p^2})$ on~$\PP
(E[p]\otimes_{\F_p}\F_{p^2})\cong\PP^1(\F_{p^2})$.

The preceding theorem shows that very few twists of~$E$, if any, can be
$p$-congruent to~$E$, since $E[p]$ must lose the property of being
absolutely irreducible after base-change to a small degree extension
$L/K$. The following two results show that the two fields $F$ and $L$ are related in the presence of a congruence between twists.

\begin{corollary}\label{C:constraint}
Suppose that $p>2$ and $E[p]$ is absolutely irreducible as
$G_K$-module.  Let $F$ be the projective $p$-division field of~$E$.
If $E$ is $p$-congruent to a proper twist $E'$ (not isomorphic to~$E$
over~$K$), and $L\supsetneq K$ is an extension of~$K$ over which $E$
and~$E'$ become isomorphic, then $E[p]$ is not absolutely irreducible
as $G_L$-module and $K\subsetneq L\cap F\subseteq F$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Apart from the last assertion this is just a restatement of
Theorem~\ref{T:constraint}.  To prove the last assertion, we certainly
have $K\subseteq L\cap F\subseteq F$, and if $K=L\cap F$ then the
projective image of~$G_L$ would be the same as that of~$G_K$,
so~$E[p]$ would be absolutely irreducible as~$G_L$-module.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{L:LinF}
Let $p > 2$ be a prime and $n \in \{2,4,6\}$. 
Let $E/K$ be an elliptic curve admitting a $p$-congruence to its non-trivial $n$-twist by~$u \in K$. Let also $L = K(\root n \of u)$. 

If $E[p]$ is an absolutely irreducible $G_K$-module then $L \subset F$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} 
Let $E'$ be the twist of~$E$ by~$u$. Clearly, over $L$ the curves $E$ and $E'$ are isomorphic, so $K\subsetneq L\cap F\subseteq F$
by Corollary~\ref{C:constraint}.
We divide the rest of the proof in three cases:

(i) If $[L : K]$ is prime, that is $[L : K] \in \{2, 3\}$, then $L \subset F$. This covers the case $n=2$, the cases for $n=6$ where $u$ is a square and the special case $n=4$, $u=-4$ discussed in
Remark~\ref{R:2-isog}. 


(ii) Suppose $n=4$. Thus $j(E) = 1728$ and $E$ has CM by~$\Q(\sqrt{-1})$. Also, 
$\sqrt{-1} \not\in K$ as $E[p]$ is absolutely irreducible. From the previous case, we can also assume 
$u \neq -4$ modulo 4th powers, hence
$[L : K]=4$. Let $M = K(\sqrt{u})$. The subfields of~$L$ are 
$K$, $M$ and $L$ and so 
$M \subset F \cap L$ because $F \cap L \neq K$. 

Suppose $M \neq K(\sqrt{-1})$. The curves $E/M$ and $E'/M$ are 
quadratic twists by $\sqrt{u}$,
they are $p$-congruent 
and $(E/M)[p]$ is and absolutely irreducibile $G_M$-module ({\bf why?}). 

Let $F_M$ be the projective $p$-division torsion field of~$E/M$. Applying the case $n=2$ proved above to
$E/M$ gives $L \subset F_W = F$ where the last field equality follows because $M \subset F$.

We are left with the case 
$M = K(\sqrt{-1})$. This means that $u = - s^2$ with $s \in K$ and so  $u = -4 s_0^2$ with $s_0 \in K$. Thus applying to~$E'$ the $2$-isogeny from Remark~\ref{R:2-isog} reduces to the case $u = s_0^2$. 
Since the $2$-isogeny does not change~$F$, the 
result follows from the case $n=2$.

(iii) Suppose $n=6$. Thus $j(E) = 0$ and $E$ has CM by $\Q(\sqrt{-3})$. Also,
$\sqrt{-3} \not\in K$ as $E[p]$ is absolutely irreducible. From case (i) we can also assume 
$[L : K ] = 6$, that is 
$L = K(\sqrt{u},\root 3 \of u)$.

Let $M = F \cap L$.
We have $M = K(\sqrt{u}), 
K(\root 3 \of{u})$ or~$L$; in the last case we are done.

Suppose $M = K(\root 3 \of{u})$ or 
$M = K(\sqrt{u}) \neq K(\sqrt{-3})$. 
Arguing as in case (ii) with $E/M$ gives the desired conclusion.

We are left with the case 
$M = K(\sqrt{-3})$. This means that $u = -3 s^2$ with $s \in K$ and so  $u = -27 s_0^2$ with $s_0 \in K$. Thus applying to~$E'$ the $3$-isogeny from Remark~\ref{R:3-isog} reduces to the case $u = s_0^2$. The result follows from (i) as the $3$-isogeny does not change~$F$.
\end{proof}

\section{Congruences between quartic and sextic twists}

Quadratic twists act on congruent pairs of curves, preserving the
symplectic type.  In the case of quartic and sextic twists the
situation is more complicated.  Note that any $p$-congruence
$\varphi:E_1[p]\to E_2[p]$ is linear and hence satisfies
$\varphi(-P)=-\varphi(P)$ for all~$P\in E_1[p]$.  However, when
$\Aut(E_1)=\Aut(E_2)=\calO^*$ has order~$4$ or~$6$, the Galois
isomorphism~$\varphi$ may either be $\calO$-linear or
$\calO$-antilinear.  Explicitly, we either have
\begin{equation}\label{E:forward-congruence}
\varphi(\zeta\cdot P) = \zeta\cdot\varphi(P)
\qquad\text{for all~$P\in  E_1[p]$ and~$\zeta\in\calO^*$;}
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}\label{E:backward-congruence}
\varphi(\zeta\cdot P) = \zeta^{-1}\cdot\varphi(P) = \overline\zeta\cdot\varphi(P)
\qquad\text{ for all~$P\in E_1[p]$ and~$\zeta\in\calO^*$.}
\end{equation}
We call these \emph{$\calO$-linear} and \emph{$\calO$-antilinear}
congruences respectively.  With antilinear congruences, in order to
obtain a new congruence we must apply \emph{opposite} twists to the
two curves.

\begin{proposition}\label{P:twist-cong}
Let~$p$ be an odd prime.  Let $E_1$ and~$E_2$ be elliptic curves
defined over a number field~$K$ such that there exists a
$p$-congruence $\varphi:E_1[p]\to E_2[p]$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Let $d\in K^*$; then we also have a $p$-congruence $E_1^d[p]\cong
  E_2^d[p]$ between the quadratic twists by~$d$.
\item
  Suppose that $j(E_1)=j(E_2)=1728$, with $E_1=E_{a_1,0}$ and
  $E_2=E_{a_2,0}$.  If $\varphi$ is an $\calO$-linear congruence, then
  for all $u\in K^*$ we also have a $p$-congruence $E_{ua_1,0}\cong
  E_{ua_2,0}$, while if $\varphi$ is $\calO$-antilinear, then for all
  $u\in K^*$ we also have a $p$-congruence $E_{u^{-1}a_1,0}\cong
  E_{ua_2,0}$.
\item
  Suppose that $j(E_1)=j(E_2)=0$, with $E_1=E_{0,b_1}$ and
  $E_2=E_{0,b_2}$.  If $\varphi$ is an $\calO$-linear, then for all
  $u\in K^*$ we also have a $p$-congruence $E_{0,ub_1}\cong
  E_{0,ub_2}$, while if $\varphi$ is $\calO$-antilinear, then for all
  $u\in K^*$ we also have a $p$-congruence $E_{0,u^{-1}b_1}\cong
  E_{0,ub_2}$.
\end{enumerate}
In all cases, the symplectic type of the congruence is preserved.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
For quadratic twists this is \cite[Lemma~11]{FKSym}, but there the
cases of quartic and sextic twists were not included, so we give a
complete proof here.

(1) Let $\sigma$ be the nontrivial automorphism of $K(\sqrt{d})/K$ and
denote by $[-1]$ the negation automorphism on each elliptic curve.
Since $\eps_d(\sigma)=-1$, by Lemma~\ref{L:twist-rep} we have for
$k=1,2$ isomorphisms $\alpha_k:E_k\to E_k^d$, defined
over~$K(\sqrt{d})$, and satisfying
\[
\alpha_k^{\sigma} = [-1]\circ\alpha_k = \alpha_k\circ[-1].
\]
Given the $G_K$-equivariant isomorphism $\varphi:E_1[p]\to E_2[p]$,
define $\varphi_d:E_1^d[p]\to E_2^d[p]$ by
$\varphi_d=\alpha_2\circ\varphi\circ\alpha_1^{-1}$.  Then $\varphi_d$
is a $G_{K(\sqrt{d})}$-equivariant linear isomorphism, also satisfying
\[
\varphi_d^{\sigma} =
\alpha_2^{\sigma}\circ\varphi^{\sigma}\circ(\alpha_1^{-1})^{\sigma} =
\alpha_2\circ[-1]\circ\varphi\circ[-1]\circ\alpha_1^{-1} = \varphi_d,
\]
since $[-1]\circ\varphi=\varphi\circ[-1]$.  Hence $\varphi_d$ is
in fact $G_K$-equivariant.

(2), (3) When $\varphi$ is $\calO$-linear, satisfying
(\ref{E:forward-congruence}), the argument is very similar.  Define
$\alpha_k:E_{a_k,0}\to E_{ua_k,0}$ for $k=1,2$ to be a quartic or
sextic twist by~$u$, satisfying
\[
\alpha_k^{\sigma} = \psi(\sigma)\circ\alpha_k = \alpha_k\circ\psi(\sigma),
\]
where $\psi$ is the twisting cocycle with values in~$\calO^*$, and we
choose normalised isomorphisms $\calO\cong\End(E_k)$ so that each
$\alpha_k$ is $\calO$-linear.  Now define
$\varphi_u=\alpha_2\circ\varphi\circ\alpha_1^{-1}$ and check as before
that $\varphi_u$ is $G_K$-equivariant, now using
(\ref{E:forward-congruence}).

When $\varphi$ instead satisfies (\ref{E:backward-congruence}), define
$\alpha_2:E_{a_2,0}\to E_{ua_2,0}$ to be the twist by~$u$ as before,
so that again
\[
\alpha_2^{\sigma} = \alpha_2\circ\psi(\sigma),
\]
but now define~$\alpha_1:E_{a_1,0}\to E_{u^{-1}a_1,0}$ to be the twist
by~$u^{-1}$, so that
\[ \alpha_1^{\sigma} = \alpha_1\circ\psi(\sigma)^{-1}.
\]
Setting $\varphi_u=\alpha_2\circ\varphi\circ\alpha_1^{-1}$, we may
again check that $\varphi_u$ is $G_K$-equivariant, using
(\ref{E:backward-congruence}).

Finally, in all cases, since the isomorphisms $\alpha_k$ all preserve
the Weil pairing, the symplectic types of $\varphi$
and~$\alpha_2\circ\varphi\circ\alpha_1^{-1}$ are the same.
\end{proof}

%% Now suppose that $d=-1\notin(K^*)^2$, and that one of the curves,
%% say~$E_1$, has $j$-invariant~$1728$; so at least one of the quadratic
%% twists is special.  Now $\rhobar_{E_1,p}$ has image contained in the
%% normaliser of a Cartan subgroup but not in the Cartan itself; by
%% Proposition~\ref{P:twist} we have $E_1[p]\cong E_1^{-1}[p]$.  Since $E_1[p]\cong E_2[p]$, 
%% we also have $E_2[p]\cong E_2^{-1}[p]$ for the same reason, and hence $E_1^{-1}[p]\cong E_2^{-1}[p]$.

%% As for the symplectic type, if also $j(E_2)=1728$ so that both twists
%% are special, then both isomorphisms $E_k[p]\cong E_k^{-1}[p]$ have the
%% same type, each being symplectic if and only if $(2/p)=1$ by Theorem~\ref{T:Cartan}~(1).  Hence the composite
%% $E_1^{-1}[p]\cong E_1[p]\cong E_2[p]\cong E_2^{-1}[p]$ has the same
%% type as $E_1[p]\cong E_2[p]$.  But if $j(E_2)\not=1728$ then
%% Theorem~\ref{T:Cartan} implies that $E_2[p]\cong E_2^{-1}[p]$ is
%% always symplectic, for the image is split if and only
%% if~$p\equiv1\pmod4$.

One can construct more complicated situations.  Suppose that
$E_1[p]\cong E_2[p]$ where $j(E_1)=1728$ but $j(E_2)\not=1728$.  Now
it is possible to apply the quartic twist by~$-4$ to $E_1$, obtaining
$E_1'$ (say), and also apply the $-1$-quadratic twist to~$E_2$.  Then
we also have a $p$-congruence between the twists $E_1'$ and
$E_2^{-1}$, since $E_1$ and $E_1'$ are congruent, being $2$-isogenous,
while $E_2$ and $E_2^{-1}$ are also congruent, by
Theorem~\ref{T:Cartan}.  The latter congruence is symplectic while the
former has symplectic type depending on $\legendre{2}{p}$.  Hence the
new $p$-congruence between the twists $E_1'$ and $E_2^{-1}$ has the
same symplectic type as the original if and only if
$p\equiv\pm1\pmod8$.

\begin{example}
Let $E_1=\lmfdbec{288}{a}{1}$ and $E_2=\lmfdbec{32544}{b}{1}$, of
which only the first has $j=1728$.  We have $E_1[7]\cong E_2[7]$, with
a symplectic isomorphism.  Twisting both curves as in the previous
paragraph gives the pair $E_1'=\lmfdbec{288}{a}{2}$ and
$E_2^{-1}=\lmfdbec{32544}{c}{1}$, which again have symplectically
isomorphic mod~$7$ representations as expected since
$\legendre{2}{7}=+1$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  $E_1=\lmfdbec{32}{a}{1}$ has $j$-invariant $1728$, its $2$-isogenous
  twist is $E_1'=\lmfdbec{32}{a}{2}$, and these are antisymplectically
  congruent mod~$5$ since $\legendre{2}{5}=-1$.  They are also
  congruent mod~$5$ to $E_2=\lmfdbec{608}{b}{1}$ and its $-1$-twist
  $E_2^{-1}=\lmfdbec{608}{e}{1}$, which are symplectically
  $5$-congruent to each other in accordance with
  Theorem~\ref{T:Cartan}.  The mod~$5$ congruence between
  $\lmfdbec{32}{a}{1}$ and $\lmfdbec{608}{b}{1}$ is symplectic while
  that between $\lmfdbec{32}{a}{2}$ and $\lmfdbec{608}{e}{1}$ is
  antisymplectic, so in this case applying the twists reverses the
  symplectic type, as expected since $\legendre{2}{5}=-1$.
\end{example}

\begin{example} \label{Ex:3twists}
  For an example with projective image~$C_2\times C_2$, let $E$ be the
  elliptic curve with LMFDB label~\lmfdbec{6534}{a}{1}, of conductor
  $6534=2\cdot3^3\cdot11^2$.  The image of the projective mod~$3$
  Galois representation is the normalizer of the split Cartan, which
  is isomorphic to $D_4 = C_2\times C_2$.  The three quadratic
  subfields of the projective $3$-division field are $\Q(\sqrt{-3})$,
  $\Q(\sqrt{-11})$, and~$\Q(\sqrt{33})$; the corresponding quadratic
  twist of~$E$ are $E^{-3}=\lmfdbec{6534}{v}{1}$,
  $E^{-11}=\lmfdbec{6534}{p}{1}$, and $E^{33}=\lmfdbec{6534}{h}{1}$
  respectively.  All four curves have isomorphic mod~$3$
  representations, the isomorphism being antisymplectic between~$E$
  and~$E^{-11}$ and~$E^{33}$, and symplectic between $E$ and~$E^{-3}$,
  in accordance with Theorem~\ref{T:Cartan}.

\begin{comment}
  \textbf{We no longer need the following, since the new version of
    Theorem~\ref{T:Cartan} says that the symplectic twist is the one
    by $3^*=-3$!}
  
  The conclusion on the symplectic types follows from part 2) of Theorem~\ref{T:Cartan} once we show
  that $E[3]$ and $E^{-3}[3]$ are symplectically isomorphic. We will show this by applying \cite[Theorem~5]{FKSym} with $\ell = 11$. We use the notation of {\it loc. cit.}. Write $E' = E^{-3}$. The curves $E/\Q_{11}$ and $E'/\Q_{11}$ have minimal models satisfying
  \[
  \vv_{11}(\Delta_m) = \vv_{11}(\Delta_m') = 3 \quad \text{ and } \quad \tilde{\Delta} = -1259712, \quad \tilde{\Delta}' = -1728.
  \]
 Thus $e = e' = 4$ by \cite[Proposition~1]{Kraus1990}. 
Moreover, we have $\vv_{11}(\Delta_m) \equiv \vv_{11}(\Delta_m')
\pmod{4}$ and none of $\tilde{\Delta}$, $\tilde{\Delta}'$ is a square mod~$11$. Thus, $r=t=0$ and $E[3]$ and $E'[3]$ are symplectically isomorphic $G_{\Q_{11}}$-modules, hence $E[3]$ and $E'[3]$ are also symplectically isomorphic $G_\Q$-modules.

\begin{example} \label{Ex:LocalFail7}
Consider the elliptic curve
\[ E : y^2 + y = x^3 - x^2 - 74988699621831x +  238006866237979285299, \]
which has conductor $ N_E = 7^2 \cdot 2381 \cdot
134177^2>2\cdot10^{15}$, so is not in the LMFDB database.  This
example was found using the explicit parametrization of curves for
which the image of the mod~$7$ Galois representation is contained in
the normalizer of a non-split Cartan subgroup; we verified by explicit
computation that the image is equal to the full normalizer.

Let $d = -7 \cdot 134177$ and consider~$E^d$ the quadratic twist
of~$E$ by~$d$. Applying Theorem~\ref{T:j=1728} (or the general method
from Section~\ref{S:statistics}) yields that $E[7] \simeq E^d[7]$ are
symplectically isomorphic~$G_\Q$-modules and not anti-symplectically
isomorphic. Moreover, one can verify that none of the local criteria
in~\cite{FKSym} applies for this case.

\subsection{Congruences between elliptic curves with
  $j$-invariant~$1728$}

We now consider whether $p$-congruences can hold between two curves
which are quartic twists, both having $j$-invariant~$1728$.  In this
subsection we denote the curve $E_{a,0}:\ Y^2=X^3+aX$ simply by~$E_a$.

We know that $E_a[p]\cong E_{-4a}[p]$ for all~$p>2$, since $E_a$ and
$E_{-4a}$ are $2$-isogenous (see Remark~\ref{R:2-isog}).  Since we are
only interested in the situation where $E[p]$ is absolutely
irreducible, the projective image $\PP\rhobar_{E,p}(G_K)$ is the
dihedral group $D_n$ with $n\ge2$.  Our result for these curves is
that there are no further congruences between them for any~$p>2$,
unless $n=2$ or $4$.

\begin{theorem}\label{T:j=1728}
Let $K$ be a number field.  For all $a \in K^*$ and all primes~$p>2$,
the elliptic curves $E_a$ and $E_{-4a}$ have isomorphic mod-$p$ Galois
representations, the isomorphism being symplectic if and only if $2$
is a quadratic residue modulo~$p$, \textit{i.e.}, if and only if
$p\equiv\pm1\pmod8$.

Let $E$ be an elliptic curve with $j(E)=1728$ and let $p$ be an odd
prime such that $E[p]$ is absolutely irreducible, so that the
projective image $\PP\rhobar_{E,p}(G_K)$ is~$D_n$ for some $n\ge2$ and
$\sqrt{-1}\not\in K$.  Suppose that $E$ is $p$-congruent to its
quartic twist by $u$, for some $u\in K^*$ not a $4$th power.  Let
$L=K(\root4\of{u})$ and let $F$ be the projective $p$-division field
of~$E$ (of degree~$2n$).

Then, as well as the congruence induced by the $2$-isogeny (with
$u=-4$) we have the following cases.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If $n=2$ then $F=K(\sqrt{-1},\sqrt{d})$ for some $d\in K^*$
    such that $\pm d\not\in(K^*)^2$.  Then $u\in\{-4,d^2,-4d^2\}$
    (modulo $4$th powers), and we have in addition congruences with
    the quadratic twist by~$d^2$, and with the curve $2$-isogenous to
    it.
  \item If $n=4$ then there are \textbf{[possibly]} two additional
    quartic congruences with curves $2$-isogenous to each other.
  \item If $n=3$ or $n>4$ then there are no further congruences.
\end{enumerate}
In case (1), if $\sqrt{p^*}\not\in K$, then we may take $d=p^*$, the
quadratic twist by~$p^*$ is symplectic and the $2$-isogeny is
anti-symplectic; this case can only occur when $p\equiv\pm3\pmod8$;
while if $\sqrt{p^*}\in K$, then all the twists are symplectic; so this
case can only occur when $p\equiv\pm1\pmod8$.

In case (2), the additional quartic twists have opposite symplectic
type when $p\equiv\pm3\pmod8$, and the same type when
$p\equiv\pm1\pmod8$ \textbf{[but I don't know which!]}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The first part follows from the isogeny criterion since $E_a$
and~$E_{-4a}$ are $2$-isogenous.

Suppose that $E$ is $p$-congruent to $E'$, its quartic twist by~$u$,
where $u$ is not a $4$th power.

For the second part, we first consider quadratic congruences with
$u=v^2$ and $\pm v$ not squares in~$K$.  Then $L=K(\sqrt{v})$ is a
quadratic extension, not equal to $K(\sqrt{-1})$, contained in~$F$,
and by Theorem~\ref{T:constraint}, the projective image of $G_L$ is
not absolutely irreducible, hence has order~$2$.  Hence $n=4$, and
$F=K(\sqrt{-1}, \sqrt{v})$.  The situation is as in
Theorem~\ref{T:Cartan}~(2).

When $n=2$ there are no more congruent twists other than the ones
described in the previous paragraph.  Any such twist would be by $u$
such that $\pm u$ are not squares.  Then $[L:K]=4$, since $K\subsetneq
K(\sqrt{u})\subsetneq L=K(\root4\of{u})$.  Writing
$F=K(\sqrt{-1},\sqrt{d})$, applying Theorem~\ref{T:constraint} which
says that $F\cap L$ is a nontrivial extension of~$K$, we have
$K(\sqrt{\pm d}) = F\cap L= K(\sqrt{u})$, and hence $u$ is $\pm d$
times a square in~$K$.  [?] Applying a quadratic twist and/or the
$2$-isogeny reduces to the case where $u=d$. \textbf{Now what?!}

Now suppose that $n>2$.  Apart from the $2$-isogeny, any other
congruent twist must have $\pm u$ non-square, so $[L:K]=4$.  By
Theorem~\ref{T:constraint}, $F\supset K(\sqrt{u})\not=K(\sqrt{-1})$,
so in fact $F$ contains the biquadratic
extension~$K(\sqrt{-1},\sqrt{u})$.  By Theorem~\ref{T:constraint}
again, the projective image of $G_{K(\sqrt{u})}$ must be (absolutely)
reducible, hence of order at most~$2$.  This is only possible if
$F\supset L$ and $n=4$.  This gives two possible values of~$u$ (modulo
$4$th powers and inverses), differing by a factor of~$-4$.  Note that
we cannot have congruences with both the quartic twists by $u$ and
by~$u^{-1}$, since then the two twists would be quadratic twists of
each other, and we have seen that this is impossible except when
$n=2$.
\end{proof}


%% Suppose that $E_{a_1}[p]\cong E_{a_2}[p]$ and the image condition
%% holds.  Since $\PP \rhobar_{E_{a_1},p}(G_K)$ has order greater than~$8$,
%% we have that $\PP \rhobar_{E_{a_1},p}(G_L)\not\cong C_2\times C_2$, for any extension $L/K$ at most quadratic.

%% We first claim that if $E_{a_1}$ and~$E_{a_2}$ are not isomorphic
%% over~$K$ but are quadratic twists, then they are special quadratic
%% twists.
%% Applying Proposition~\ref{P:twist}, the image of $\rhobar_{E,p}$ is
%% contained in the normaliser~$N$ of a Cartan subgroup~$C$, but not
%% contained in the Cartan itself, where $C$ cuts out the quadratic
%% extension $K(\sqrt{d})/K$.  By hypothesis the projective image is
%% not~$C_2\times C_2$, so this is true for a unique pair $(N,C)$.  Hence
%% the non-trivial quadratic extension cut out by $C$ must be the CM
%% extension $K(\sqrt{-1})$; in particular, $\sqrt{-1} \not\in K$.  Hence
%% $K(\sqrt{d})=K(\sqrt{-1})$, proving the claim.

%% We now consider two cases:

%% (i) Assume $a_1/a_2 = d^2$ with $d\in K^*$. If $d$ is a square in~$K$
%% then the curves are isomorphic.  Otherwise, by the claim, they are
%% quadratic twists by~$K(\sqrt{d})=K(\sqrt{-1})$.  But then
%% $-d\in(K^*)^2$, so $a_1/a_2=(-d)^2\in(K^*)^4$, and again the curves
%% are isomorphic over~$K$.  So if $a_1/a_2$ is a square in~$K$, then it must in
%% fact be a $4$th power.

%% (ii) Assume $a_1/a_2$ is not a square in~$K$.  Let $m=\sqrt{a_1/a_2}$
%% and set $L=K(m)$. Thus $a_1/a_2 = m^2$ with $m \in L$ and $E_{a_1}$ is
%% isomorphic to~$E_{a_2}$ over~$L(\sqrt{m})$.  Since $E_{a_1}[p]\cong
%% E_{a_2}[p]$ as $G_L$-modules, and the projective image $\rhobar_{E_{a_1},p}(G_L)$
%% has order greater than~$4$, by case (i) over~$L$ we conclude that the
%% curves are in fact isomorphic over~$L$.  Since $L$ is a quadratic
%% extension of~$K$, the claim gives $L=K(\sqrt{-1})$.  From the discussion preceding the theorem, we have
%% $E_{a_2}\cong E_{a_1}^{-1} \cong E_{-4a_1}$, so $a_1/a_2 = -4$ (modulo
%% 4th powers).

\begin{example}
$K=\Q$, $p=3$, $j=1728$.  The projective image is the normaliser of a
  non-split Cartan, isomorphic to~$D_4$.  One can check that up to
  $4$th powers, the subgroup of $\Q^*/(\Q^*)^4$ which become $4$th
  powers in the projective $3$-division field of~$E_a$ is generated
  by~$-3/a^2$ and~$-4$.  Hence we expect $3$-congruences between $E_a$
  and either $E_{-3/a}$ (twisting by~$u=-3/a^2$) or $E_{-a^3/3}$
  (twisting by~$u=-a^2/3$).  Only the first holds.  We may also check
  that $E_a$ and~$E_{-3/a}$ are $3$-congruent via a congruence which
  is $\Z[\zeta_4]$-antilinear.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
$K=\Q$, $p=5$, $j=1728$.  The projective image is the normaliser of a
  split Cartan, isomorphic to~$D_4$.  One can check that up to $4$th
  powers, the subgroup of $\Q^*/(\Q^*)^4$ which become $4$th powers in
  the projective $5$-division field of~$E_a$ is generated by~$5/a^2$
  and~$-4$.  Hence we expect $5$-congruences between $E_a$ and either
  $E_{5/a}$ (twisting by~$u=5/a^2$) or $E_{a^3/5}$ (twisting
  by~$u=a^2/5$).  Only the first holds.  We may also check that $E_a$
  and~$E_{5/a}$ are $5$-congruent via a congruence which is
  $\Z[\zeta_4]$-antilinear.
\end{example}

\subsection{Congruences between elliptic curves with
  $j$-invariant~$0$}

We now consider whether $p$-congruences can hold between two curves
which are sextic twists, both having $j$-invariant~$0$.  In this
subsection we denote the curve $E_{0,b}:\ Y^2=X^3+b$ simply by~$E_b$.

We know that $E_b[p]\cong E_{-27b}[p]$ for all~$p>3$, since $E_b$ and
$E_{-27b}$ are $3$-isogenous (see Remark~\ref{R:3-isog}).  Since we
are only interested in the situation where $E[p]$ is absolutely
irreducible, the projective image $\PP\rhobar_{E,p}(G_K)$ is the
dihedral group $D_n$ with $n\ge2$.  Our result for these curves is
that there are no further congruences between them for any~$p>2$,
unless $n=2$, $3$ or~$6$. \textbf{Check this statement after proving
  the theorem!}

\begin{theorem}\label{T:j=0}
Let $K$ be a number field.  For all $b \in K^*$ and all primes~$p>2$,
the elliptic curves $E_b$ and $E_{-27b}$ have isomorphic mod-$p$
Galois representations, the isomorphism being symplectic if and only
if $3$ is a quadratic residue modulo~$p$, \textit{i.e.}, if and only
if $p\equiv\pm1\pmod{12}$.

Let $E$ be an elliptic curve with $j(E)=0$ and let $p\ge5$ be a prime
such that $E[p]$ is absolutely irreducible, so that the projective
image $\PP\rhobar_{E,p}(G_K)$ is~$D_n$ for some $n\ge2$ and
$\sqrt{-3}\not\in K$.  Suppose that $E$ is $p$-congruent to its sextic
twist by $u$, for some $u\in K^*$ not a $6$th power.  Let
$L=K(\root6\of{u})$ and let $F$ be the projective $p$-division field
of~$E$ (of degree~$2n$).

Then, as well as the congruence induced by the $3$-isogeny (with
$u=-27$) we have the following cases.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If $n=2$ then $F=K(\sqrt{-3},\sqrt{d})$ for some $d\in K^*$
    such that $d,-3d\not\in(K^*)^2$.  Then $u\in\{-27,d^3,-27d^3\}$
    (modulo $6$th powers), and we have in addition congruences with
    the quadratic twist by~$d^3$, and with the curve $3$-isogenous to
    it.
  \item If $n=3$ then there are \textbf{[possibly]} two additional
    sextic congruences with curves $3$-isogenous to each other.
  \item If $n=6$ then there are \textbf{[possibly]} two additional
    sextic congruences with curves $3$-isogenous to each other.
  \item If $n\not=2,3,6$ then there are no further congruences.
\end{enumerate}
In case (1), if $\sqrt{p^*}\not\in K$, then we may take $d=p^*$, the
quadratic twist by~$p^*$ is symplectic and the $3$-isogeny is
anti-symplectic; this case can only occur when $p\equiv\pm5\pmod{12}$;
while if $\sqrt{p^*}\in K$, then all the twists are symplectic; so
this case can only occur when $p\equiv\pm1\pmod{12}$.

In cases (2) and~(3), the additional sextic twists have opposite
symplectic type when $p\equiv\pm5\pmod{12}$, and the same type when
$p\equiv\pm1\pmod{12}$ \textbf{[but I don't know which!]}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The first part follows from the isogeny criterion since $E_b$
and~$E_{-27b}$ are $3$-isogenous.

For the second part, suppose that $E=E_b$ is $p$-congruent to its
sextic twist $E'=E_{bu}$, where $u$ is not a $6$th power.  We divide
into cases: (i) $u=v^3$ and $v$ not a square in~$K$ (so the twist is a
quadratic twist); (ii) $u=v^2$ with $v$ not a cube; (iii) $u=-3v^2$
with $v$ not a cube; (iv) $u$ not a cube and $u\not\equiv1,-3$ (modulo
squares).

Case~(i) (quadratic twists): Suppose that $u=v^3$ and $v$ not a square
in~$K$.  Now $L=K(\sqrt{v})$ is a quadratic extension, contained
in~$F$, and by Theorem~\ref{T:constraint}, the projective image of
$G_L$ is not absolutely irreducible.  Either $L=\Q(\sqrt{-3})$, or the
image of~$G_L$ has order~$2$ and hence $n=2$, and $F=K(\sqrt{-3},
\sqrt{v})$.  In the first case $u\equiv-27$ (modulo $6$ powers) and
the congruence is with the $3$-isogenous curve $E_{-27b}$.  Otherwise,
the situation is as in Theorem~\ref{T:Cartan}~(2) with projective
image~$C_2\times C_2$.  If $p^*$ is not a square in~$K$ then we have
$v=p^*$ (replacing $v$ by $-3v$ if necessary), the quadratic twist
by~$p^*$ is symplectic while those by $-3$ and $-3p^*$ are
antisymplectic.  This implies that $\legendre{3}{p}=-1$, so can only
happen when $p\equiv\pm5\pmod{12}$.  Otherwise, if $p^*$ is a square
in~$K$, then all three quadratic twists are symplectic, so this can
only happen when $p\equiv\pm1\pmod{12}$.

To complete part (1) of the statement of the theorem, we need to show
that when $n=2$ there are no more congruent twists other than the
three quadratic twists.  This requires an application of Case~(ii).
Any such twist would be by $u$ such that $u$ is not a cube in~$K$.
Since $[F:K]=4$, $K(\root3\of{u})\not\subseteq F$, which imples by
Theorem~\ref{T:constraint} that $E_b$ is not $p$-congruent
to~$E_{bu^3}$, hence $u$ is not a square.  Now
$L=K(\root6\of{u})=K(\sqrt{u},\root3\of{u})$, so by
Theorem~\ref{T:constraint} again, we have $F\cap L = K(\sqrt{u})$.
But then $E_b$ would be congruent to the quadratic twist~$E_{bu^3}$,
contradiction. \textbf{I'm sure this last part can be simplified!}

Case~(ii).  Suppose that $u\in(K^*)^2$ but $u\not\in(K^*)^3$.  We show
that this is impossible unless $n=3$.  Let
$L=K(\root6\of{u})=K(\root3\of{u})$.  By Theorem~\ref{T:constraint} we
have $L\subseteq F$, and in fact $F=L(\sqrt{-3})$ and $n=3$, as
otherwise $E[p]$ would remain absolutely irreducible as $G_L$-module.
\textbf{I cannot exclude this case, and I think it is what happens
  over $\Q(\sqrt{-7})$ when $p=7$.  For we know that $E_1$ and
  $E_{-28}$ are $7$-congruent over~$\Q$, where $n=6$; base-changing to
  $K=\Q(\sqrt{-7})$ reduces $n$ to $3$ and makes $u=-28$ a square but
  not a cube.}

Case~(iii): Suppose that $u\not\in(K^*)^3$ and $u\equiv-3$ (modulo
squares).  Now $E_b$ is $p$-congruent to both $E_{bu}$ and $E_{-27b}$,
so the latter are $p$-congruent to each other and twists by~$-27/u$
which is not a cube.  This contradicts Case~(ii), unless $n=6$.
\textbf{This is the $n$ for $E_{bu}$ not $E_b$ though \dots}

Case~(iv).  Suppose that $u\not\in(K^*)^3$ and $u\not\equiv1,-3$
(modulo squares).  Let $L_1=K(\root3\of{u})$.  Over~$L_1$, the
isomorphism $E_b\to E_{bu}$ becomes a quadratic twist, so we apply
Case~(i).  Since $u\not\equiv-3$ (modulo squares) in $L_1$, the
projective image of $G_{L_1}$ must be $C_2\times C_2$ since over~$L_1$
we have more than one quadratic twist (by~$u$ and by~$-3$) which is
$p$-congruent to~$E_b$.  Hence $n=6$.  If $p^*$ is not a square in
$K$, it is also not a square in $L$, so $u\equiv p^*$
or~$u\equiv-3p^*$ modulo~$(L_1^*)^2$, and also modulo~$(K^*)^2$.
%% [Replacing $u$ by $-27u$ if necessary we may assume that $u\equiv p^*$
%% modulo squares, in $L$ and hence also in $K$.]

So the projective image of $G_K$ has order~$12$, isomorphic to the
dihedral group~$D_6$, and $K(\root3\of{u})$ is the unique (up to
conjugacy) degree~$3$ subfield of~$F$.  This uniquely determines
$u^{\pm1}$ (modulo cubes).  Since $u$ is uniquely determined modulo
squares (up to multiplication by~$-3$) and cubes (up to replacing $u$
by $u^{-1}$, this almost uniquely identifies the sextic twist
$E_{bu}$.  Note that there cannot exist sextic twists by both $u$ and
$u^{-1}$ by Case~(ii), unless $u$ is a cube so that these are the same
twists.

The symplectic type of these extra congruences can be determined by
base-changing to~$L_1$ where they become quadratic twists.  In case
$p^*$ is not a square in~$K$, the sextic twist by $u\equiv p^*$
(modulo squares) is also symplectic, while the sextic twist by
$u\equiv -3p^*$ (modulo squares) is anti-symplectic; also, the
quadratic twist by~$-3$ is anti-symplectic, so this can only occur
when $p\equiv\pm5\pmod{12}$.  If $p^*$ is \ square in~$K$ then the
extra sextic twists are both symplectic, as is the $3$-isogeny, so
$p\equiv\pm1\pmod{12}$.
\end{proof}



\begin{example}
$K=\Q$, $p=5$, $j=0$.  The projective image is the normaliser of a
  non-split Cartan, isomorphic to~$D_6$.  We expect a
  $5$-congruence between $E_b$ and $E_{bu}$ where $u\equiv5$ (modulo
  squares) and $u\equiv b/10$ or~$10/b$ (modulo cubes), since one may
  check that $b/10$ is a cube in $\Q(E_b[5])$.  Hence, modulo $6$th
  powers, we have either $u\equiv 4/5b^2$ or $u\equiv 5b^2/4$.
  Testing with $b=1$, we find that $E_1$ and $E_{4/5}$ are indeed
  $5$-congruent, hence $E_b$ and $E_{4/(5b)}$ are also.  This
  congruence is symplectic; composing with the $3$-isogeny we also
  have an anti-symplectic congruence between $E_b$ and
  $E_{-108/(5b)}$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
$K=\Q$, $p=7$, $j=0$.  The projective image is the normaliser of a
  split Cartan, isomorphic to~$D_6$.  We expect a $7$-congruence
  between $E_b$ and $E_{bu}$ where $u\equiv-7$ (modulo squares) and
  $u\equiv 7b/2$ or~$2/(7b)$ (modulo cubes), since one may check that
  $7b/2$ is a cube in $\Q(E_b[7])$.  Hence, modulo $6$th powers, we
  have either $u\equiv -28/b^2$ or $u\equiv -b^2/28$.  Testing with
  $b=1$, we find that $E_1$ and $E_{-28}$ are indeed $7$-congruent,
  hence $E_b$ and $E_{-28/b}$ are also.  This congruence is
  symplectic; composing with the $3$-isogeny we also have an
  anti-symplectic congruence between $E_b$ and $E_{756/b}$.
\end{example}

\subsection{[Old version] Mod $7$ isomorphisms between elliptic curves with
  $j$-invariant~$0$}

For curves with $j$-invariant~$0$ we only consider the prime~$p=7$,
and the base field~$\Q$.  Little change would be required in what
follows if $\Q$ were to be replaced by any field of characteristic
different from~$2$, $3$ or $7$ in which $-3$ is not a square.  In case
$-3$ is a square there is some simplification, and a similar result
holds.

We will show that for every elliptic curve~$E/\Q$ with $j(E)=0$, there
are three non-trivial sextic twists of~$E$ with isomorphic mod-$7$
Galois representations, one symplectic and two anti-symplectic.

Recall that every elliptic curve with $j=0$ has a model of the form
$E_b:\ Y^2=X^3+b$ with $b$ nonzero, and the isomorphism class of $E_b$
depends only on $b$ modulo $6$th powers.  Any two such curves are
sextic twists of each other: the sextic twist of $E_b$ by $u$ is
$E_{bu}$, which is isomorphic to $E_b$ if and only if $u$ is a $6$th
power.  We will prove the following:

\begin{theorem}\label{T:j=0-old}
For all $b \in \Q^*$, the elliptic curves $E_b$ and $E_{-28/b}$ have
symplectically isomorphic mod-$7$ Galois representations.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We fix some notation. Let $K=\Q(\r3)=\Q(\w)$ where $\w$ satisfies
$\w^2+\w+1=0$, so that $\w$ is a primitive $3$rd root of
unity and $-\w$ a primitive $6$th root of unity.  The
curves $E_b$ have CM by the maximal order~$\calO_K=\Z[\w]$ in which
$7$ splits as $7=\pi\pibar$ where $\pi=3\w+2$.  Set
$\r3=2w+1$ (to fix the sign).  We denote the nontrivial
automorphism of $K/\Q$ by $x\mapsto x'$.

Fix $b\in\Q^*$ defining the elliptic curve $E_b: Y^2=X^3+b$.  The
$2$-dimensional $\F_7$-vector space~$E_b[7]$ has two $K$-rational
one-dimensional subspaces, namely the kernels of the endomorphisms
$[\pi]$ and $[\pibar]$, which we make explicit.

Define
\begin{align}
\alpha&=4b/\pibar,\\
\beta=\alpha+b&=-\w^2\r3^3b/\pibar,\quad\text{and}\\
\gamma&=-4\r3^3b/\pibar = -\r3^3\alpha = 4\w\beta.
\end{align}
Note that, for any choice of roots~$\alpha^{1/3}$ and~$\beta^{1/2}$, the point $(\alpha^{1/3},\beta^{1/2})$ is 
in~$E_b(\Qbar)$.  We fix one $6$th 
root~$\gamma^{1/6}$ once and for all
and set
\begin{align}
\alpha^{1/3} &= \gamma^{1/3}/\r3,\\
\beta^{1/2} &= \gamma^{1/2}\w/2
\end{align}
(with $\gamma^{1/3}=(\gamma^{1/6})^2$ and $\gamma^{1/2}=(\gamma^{1/6})^3$).  Let
$P=(\alpha^{1/3},\beta^{1/2})\in E_b(\Qbar)$.

Computing the $7$-division polynomial of~$E_b$, we find that over
$\Q(b)$ (treating $b$ as an indeterminate) it has factors $X^3-\alpha$
and $X^3-\alpha'$, the remaining factor of degree~$18$ being
irreducible.  It follows that $P$ and the conjugate point
$P'=(\alpha'^{1/3},\beta'^{1/2})$ have order~$7$.  Also, the multiples
$kP$ for $1\le k\le6$ all have $x(kP)^3=\alpha$ (this can be checked
by direct calculation, or by observing that $x(2P)^3=\alpha'$ yields a
contradiction after repeating three times since $8P=P$).

Thus the $7$-division field of~$E_b$ is
$L=K(E_b[7])=K(P,P')=K(\gamma^{1/6},\gamma'^{1/6})$.

\begin{lemma}In all cases, $\gamma$ and~$\gamma'$ are independent in
  $K^*/K^*{}^2$.  They are independent in $K^*/K^*{}^3$ unless
  $b=2\cdot7^2\cdot c^3$ with~$c\in\Q^*{}^3$, in which case
  $\gamma\gamma'=(-42c)^3$ and they generate a subgroup of $K^*/K^*{}^3$
  of order~$3$.

In the first case we have $\Gal(L/K)\cong(\Z/6\Z)^2$.  In the second
case, $\Gal(L/K)\cong(\Z/6\Z)\times(\Z/2\Z)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Elementary.
\end{proof}
Note that $b=2\cdot7^2\cdot c^3 = 98c^3\implies -28/b=98(-7c)^3$, so the situation is
symmetric between $E_b$ and $E_{-28/b}$.  In this case, the curves
$E_b$ and $E_{-28/b}$ are not just sextic twists but quadratic twists
by $-7$, since $-28/b^2=(-7)^3/c^6$.

We now assume that we are not in the special case (where $b/98$ is a
cube), so that $\Gal(L/K)\cong(\Z/6\Z)^2$.  We will define generating
automorphisms~$\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2\in\Gal(L/K)$, each of order~$6$,
together with an automorphism~$\tau$ of order~$2$ in $\Gal(L/\Q)$ such
that $\Gal(L/\Q)=\left<\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\tau\right>$.

Fix one value of $\gamma^{1/6}$ arbitrarily.  Let $\tau\in\Gal(L/\Q)$
be an element of order~$2$ restricting to the non-trivial element of
$\Gal(K/\Q)$.  Then $(\tau(\gamma^{1/6}))^6=\tau(\gamma)=\gamma'$, so
we may fix the value of $\gamma'^{1/6}$ by setting
$\gamma'^{1/6}=\tau(\gamma)$.  Now by independence of $\gamma^{1/6}$
and $\gamma'^{1/6}$ there exists $\sigma_1\in\Gal(L/K)$ fixing
$\gamma'^{1/6}$ and mapping $\gamma^{1/6}\mapsto-w\gamma^{1/6}$ (recall
that $-w$ is a primitive $6$th root of unity) and also
$\sigma_2\in\Gal(L/K)$ fixing $\gamma^{1/6}$ and mapping
$\gamma'^{1/6}\mapsto-w^2\gamma'^{1/6}$.

Both $\sigma_1$ and~$\sigma_2$ multiply $(\gamma/\gamma')^{1/6}$ by
the same $6$th root of unity, $-w$.  Note that
$\gamma/\gamma'=-\pi/\pibar$; one may check that
$K((\gamma/\gamma')^{1/6})=K(\zeta_7)$, and that both $\sigma_1$ and
$\sigma_2$ map $\zeta_7$ to $\zeta_7^3$.  (The image must be either
$\zeta_7^3$ or $\zeta_7^5$ since $3$ and $5$ are the primitive roots
modulo~$7$.)

Recall that $P=(\alpha^{1/3},\beta^{1/2})\in E_b(K(\gamma^{1/6}))$ is
fixed by our choice of $\gamma^{1/6}$.  We similarly have
$P'=(\alpha'^{1/3},\beta'^{1/2})\in E_b(K(\gamma'^{1/6}))$, and~$\tau$
interchanges these.  Hence we have
\[
   \rho_{E_b,7}(\tau) = \begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0   \end{pmatrix}.
\]


Now $\sigma_1$ fixes~$P'$, while one may see that $\sigma_1(P)=3P$
(for example the standard formulas for adding points show that
$-2P=(w^{-5}\alpha^{1/3},\beta^{1/2})=\sigma_1^5(P)$); this also
follows from the action on the $7$th roots of unity noted above, which
implies that the determinant of the matrix giving the action of
$\sigma_1$ on $\left<P,P'\right>$ is $3\pmod7$.  This matrix is
therefore
\[
   \rho_{E_b,7}(\sigma_1) = \begin{pmatrix}3&0\\0&1   \end{pmatrix},
\]
and similarly
\[
   \rho_{E_b,7}(\sigma_2) = \begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&3   \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now we consider the effect of twisting~$E_b$ by $u=-28/b^2$.
Replacing $b$ by $ub=-28/b$ changes $\gamma$ into $(2\r3)^6/\gamma'$.
In fact if the sextic twist by~$u$ induces an isomorphism on the
$7$-torsion modules, this must have the effect of replacing $\gamma$
by $\gamma^{\pm1}$ or~$\gamma'^{\pm1}$, modulo $(K^*)^6$.  The only
solutions with $u\in\Q^*$ are $u=1$ and $u=-28/b^2$; taking into
account the fact that $\ker(\Q^*/(\Q^*)^6\to K^*/(K^*)^6) =
\{1,-27\}$, the solutions modulo~$(\Q^*)^6$ are~$\{1,-27,-28/b^2,
27\cdot28/b^2\}$.

Hence the twist by~$u=-27/b^2$ leaves the $7$-division field
$K(\gamma^{1/6},\gamma'^{1/6})$ unchanged.

The twisting map~$\tw$ takes $(x,y)\in E_b$ to $(u^{1/3}x,u^{1/2}y)\in
E_{bu}$.  Again we need to fix the roots.  We set
$u^{1/6}=2\r3/(\gamma^{1/6}\gamma'^{1/6})$, then
$u^{1/3}=-12/(\gamma^{1/3}\gamma'^{1/3})$ and
$u^{1/2}=8\r3^3/(\gamma^{1/2}\gamma'^{1/2})$.  Hence
\[
 \tw(P) = (u^{1/3}\alpha^{1/3},u^{1/2}\alpha^{1/2}) =
(4\r3/\gamma'^{1/3},-4w\r3^3/\gamma'^{1/2}),
\]
which is fixed by~$\sigma_1$ and taken to $3$ times itself
by~$\sigma_2$.  Similarly, $\sigma_2$ fixes $\tw(P')$ and
multiples~$\tw(P)$ by~$3$.

Now $\tau$ fixes $u^{1/3}$ and negates $u^{1/2}$. A simple calculation
then gives $\tau(\tw(P)) = -\tw(P')$.

Now define $\phi: E_b[7] \to E_{bu}[7]$ by $P\mapsto\tw(P')$,
$P'\mapsto-\tw(P)$.  Then $\phi$ commutes with the action of
$\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$ and~$\tau$, so is an isomorphism of
$G_\Q$-modules.  It is also symplectic:  denoting the Weil pairing by
$e_7$ we have
\[
e_7(\phi(P),\phi(P')) = e_7(\tw(P'),-\tw(P)) = e_7(P',-P) =
e_7(P',P)^{-1} = e_7(P,P'),
\]
where we have used the fact that $\tw$, being an isomorphism defined
over $\overline{\Q}$ preserves the Weil pairing.

This completes the proof that $E_b[7]$ and $E_{-28/b}[7]$ are
isomorphic as symplectic $G_{\Q}$-modules in the case where $b\notin
2\cdot7^2\cdot \Q^*{}^3$.


\begin{remark}
The fixed field of $\sigma_1\sigma_2$ is $K(\zeta_7)=\Q(\zeta_{21})$.
One may check that this is the field of definition of the full set of
$7$-isogenies of $E_b$: this is consistent with $\sigma_1\sigma_2$
having trivial image in $\PGL(2,\F_7)$.
\end{remark}

To complete the proof of Theorem~\ref{T:j=0}, assume that $b/98$ is a
cube.  Now we take $u=-7^3$, so the sextic twist by~$u$ is just the
quadratic twist by $-7$.  We fix $\gamma^{1/6}$ and $\gamma'^{1/6}$
with $\tau(\gamma^{1/6})=\gamma'^{1/6}$ as before.

Since $\gamma\gamma'\in\Q^*{}^3$, any $\sigma\in\Gal(L/K)$
maps~$\gamma^{1/6}$ to $\zeta_6^r\gamma^{1/6}$ and~$\gamma'^{1/6}$ to
$\zeta_6^s\gamma^{1/6}$ where $(r,s)\in(\Z/6\Z)^2$ satisfy
$r+s\equiv0\pmod3$.  (Here $\zeta_6=-w$.) So $\Gal(L/K)$ is isomorphic
to a subgroup of index~$3$ in~$(\Z/6\Z)^2$.  As generators we may take
$\sigma_1$ of order~$6$ mapping to $(1,-1)$, and $\sigma_2$ of
order~$2$ mapping to $(0,3)$.  Then the computations carried out for
the generic case give
\[
   \rho_{E_b,7}(\sigma_1) = \begin{pmatrix}3&0\\0&3   \end{pmatrix},
\]
and
\[
   \rho_{E_b,7}(\sigma_2) = \begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&-1   \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The twist map takes $(x,y)\mapsto(-7x,\sqrt{-7}^3y)$ and we find that
all three of $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$ and~$\tau$ map $\sqrt{-7}$ to
$-\sqrt{-7}$.  For this one may use the classical formula
\[
   \sqrt{-7} = \sum_{k\pmod7}\legendre{k}{7}\zeta_7^k.
\]
The same definition of~$\phi$ as in the generic case gives a
symplectic Galois isomorphism here, completing the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
For every $b\in\Q^*$ the curves $E_{-27b}$ and $E_{27\cdot28/b}$ have
mod~$7$ Galois representations which are antisymplectically isomorphic
to that of~$E_b$.

If $E_b[7]$ and $E_{b'}[7]$ are isomorphic then $b'\in\{b,-28/b, -27b,
27\cdot28/b\}$ (modulo sixth powers) and these values are distinct.
Hence for each elliptic curve $E/\Q$ with $j(E)=0$, there are
precisely three curves $E'/\Q$ with $j(E')=0$, excluding $E$ itself,
with isomorphic $7$-torsion.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Although one can show that $E_b$ and $E_{-27b}$ are antisymplectically
isomorphic using the same methods as used for Theorem~\ref{T:j=0}, it
is easier to note that the curves $E_b$ and~$E_{-27b}$ are
$3$-isogenous; since $3$ is a non-quadratic residue of~$7$, a
$3$-isogeny between them induces an anti-symplectic isomorphism
between their $7$-torsion modules. Alternatively, these curves are
quadratic twists by~$-3$, and the conclusion also follows from
Theorem~\ref{T:Cartan}.

The last part follows from the proof of Theorem~\ref{T:j=0}.
\end{proof}

%\begin{remark} Over a field where $-3$ is a square, the curves $E_b$
%and $E_{-27b}$ in the previous remark are even isomorphic, and the
%$3$-isogeny is the endomorphism $\pm\r3$.  \end{remark}

\section{The symplectic type of congruences between twists} \label{S:type}

Let~$K$ be a number field. Let $E$ and~$E'$ be elliptic curves over~$K$ having the same $j$-invariant $j = j(E) = j(E')$. Assume they are not 
isomorphic over~$K$. Therefore, $E$ and $E'$ are (non-trivial) twists and become isomorphic over an extension $L/K$. Write $d = [L : K]$. 

Let $t : E \to E'$ be a twist map with 
cocycle~$\psi : G_K \to \calO^* = \mu_n$.
We have 
\begin{itemize}
 \item[(i)] $n=2$ and $d = 2$ if $j  \neq 0, 1728$ (quadratic twists);
 \item[(ii)] $n=4$ and $d \in \{2,4\}$ if $j = 1728$ (quartic twists);
  \item[(iii)] $n=6$ and $d \in \{3,6\}$ if $j = 0$ (cubic or sextic twists);
\end{itemize}

We have $t^\sigma = \psi(\sigma) \cdot t$ for all~$\sigma \in G_K$. 
Denote by $t_p : E[p] \to E'[p]$ the restriction of~$t$ to the $p$-torsion points of~$E$. Thus,
\begin{equation}\label{E:cocycle}
   t_p(P)^\sigma = \psi(\sigma) \cdot t_p(P^\sigma) \quad \text{ for all } \sigma \in G_K,
  \; P \in E[p].
\end{equation}
Let $P_1, P_2$ be a basis of~$E[p]$, so that $t_p(P_1), t_p(P_2)$ is a basis of~$E'[p]$.
In these basis, the map~$t_p$ is represented by the identity matrix in~$\GL_2(\F_p)$ and~$\psi(\sigma)$ by a matrix~$\Psi_\sigma$ so
we obtain, for all $\sigma \in G_K$, the equality of matrices
\begin{equation} \label{E:PsiMatrix}
 \rhobar_{E',p}(\sigma) = \rhobar_{E,p}(\sigma) \cdot \Psi_\sigma. 
\end{equation}


Assume further that $E$ and $E'$ are $p$-congruent, so there exists an 
isomorphism of $G_K$-modules $\phi : E[p] \to E'[p]$. Let~$M \in \GL_2(\F_p)$ be the matrix representing~$\phi$ in the basis above, hence
\begin{equation}\label{E:PsiM}
M \rhobar_{E,p}(\sigma) M^{-1} = \rhobar_{E,p}(\sigma) \cdot \Psi_\sigma 
 \quad \text{ for all } \sigma \in G_K.
\end{equation}
The map $\sigma \mapsto \Psi_\sigma$ becomes an homomorphism over an extension $M/K$ given by $M=K$ if $n=2$, $M=K(\sqrt{-1})$ if $n=4$ and $M=K(\sqrt{-3})$ if $n=6$.


Since the map~$t$ is an isomorphism over~$\Qbar$ it preserves the Weil pairing, therefore the symplectic type of the congruence $E[p] \simeq E'[p]$ is determined by the square class of $\det M$.

For $p$ an odd prime, define $p^*=\pm p\equiv1\pmod4$, so that
$\Q(\sqrt{p^*})$ is the quadratic subfield of the cyclotomic
field~$\Q(\zeta_p)$. 

We start by determining the symplectic type of congruences between quadratic twists.
Since the projective
image is dihedral (by Proposition~\ref{P:twist}), this
is a situation where the local methods from~\cite{FKSym} may not
apply, as is illustrated by Example~\ref{Ex:LocalFail7} below.

\begin{theorem}\label{T:quadratic} 
Let $p > 2$ be a prime. 
Let $E/K$ be an elliptic curve 
$p$-congruent to some quadratic twist~$E^d$.
Assume $E[p]$ is an absolutely irreducible~$G_K$-module.

\begin{enumerate}
%% \item In the case of the special quadratic twist, the congruence is
%%   symplectic if and only if $(2/p)=+1$.

\item Let $C$ be the Cartan subgroup of~$\GL_2(\F_p)$
  associated to the extension $K(\sqrt{d})/K$ in
  Proposition~\ref{P:twist}.  Then the congruence is symplectic if and
  only if \emph{either} $C$ is split and $p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$,
  \emph{or} $C$ is non-split and $p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$.

\item When $\PP\rhobar_{E,p}\cong C_2\times C_2$, there are three
  different quadratic\footnote{when $j(E)=1728$ one of these
    is the quartic twist by~$-4$ so not in fact quadratic.}  twists
    of~$E$ which are $p$-congruent to~$E$.  If $\sqrt{p^*}\in K$ then
    all three congruences are symplectic.  Otherwise, one of the
    quadratic twists is by $K(\sqrt{p^*})$ and is symplectic while the
    other two are anti-symplectic.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} 
Let~$\delta \in \F_p^*$ be a square if $C$ is split and a non-square if $C$ is non-split.
From the hypothesis we can 
choose a basis $P_1, P_2$ of $E[p]$ such that 
$\rhobar_{E,p}$ has image 
contained in the subgroup of $\GL_2(\F_p)$ given by 
\[
\left\{ 
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b\delta \\
b & a
\end{pmatrix}, 
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b\delta \\
-b & -a
\end{pmatrix}  \; : a, b \in \F_p, \; a^2 - \delta b^2 \neq 0 \right\},
\]
where~$C$ is given by the first type of matrices. 
Restricting~\eqref{E:PsiM} to the index~$2$ subgroup $H = \ker \Psi_\sigma$ we see that 
that~$M \in C$ because $\rhobar_{E,p}(H) \subset C$; also, $M$ 
is non-scalar since the twist is non-trvial,
thus~$b \neq 0$. 
Moreover, for $\tau \in G_K - H$ we have 
$M \rhobar_{E,p}(\tau) M^{-1} =-\rhobar_{E,p}(\tau)$ and so $M^2$ commutes with 
$\rhobar_{E,p}(\tau)$, thus it commutes with the whole (non-abelian) image 
of~$\rhobar_{E,p}$. Thus $M^2$ is scalar, hence 
$M$ has projective order~$2$ and so it has trace 0.

We conclude that $\Tr M = 2a = 0$, so $a=0$ (as $p \neq 2$) and $\det M = -b^2\delta$. Thus $\det M$ is a square mod~$p$ if and only 
if~$(-\delta/p) = 1$. Part (1) follows by dividing this condition into the four different cases.

(2) Since the determinant of $\rhobar_{E,p}$ is the mod~$p$ cyclotomic
character, we have $\PP\rhobar_{E,p}(G_K)\subseteq \PSL_2(\F_p)$ if
and only if $\sqrt{p^*}\in K$.  When this is the case, by
Lemma~\ref{L:C2xC2} we see that each index~$2$ subgroup of the
projective image is split when $p\equiv1\pmod4$ and each is non-split
when $p\equiv3\pmod4$.  By part (1), it follows in both cases that the
congruences between~$E$ and each of the three twists are all
symplectic.

Now suppose that $\sqrt{p^*}\notin K$.  By Lemma~\ref{L:C2xC2} again,
exactly one of the three subgroups is split when $p\equiv1\pmod4$, and
exactly one is non-split when $p\equiv3\pmod4$, so in both cases
exactly one congruence is symplectic.  Moreover, since the subgroup
$C$ inducing the symplectic congruence is the unique one contained in
$\PSL_2(\F_p)$ ({\bf why?}), the associated quadratic extension is~$K(\sqrt{p^*})$.
\end{proof}

See Example~\ref{Ex:3twists} for an illustration of part 2) of
the previous theorem.


We will next use the previous theorem to describe the symplectic type of congruences between quartic twists via a base change argument. First note that the quartic twist by~$u = s^2$ is the quadratic twist by~$s$; if $u = -s^2$ then $u = -4s_0^2$ and by first applying the 2-isogeny from Remark~\ref{R:2-isog} we reduce to the case of~$u$ being a square. Applying the isogeny changes the symplectic type if and only if $(2/p) = -1$, therefore by keeping track of this, we can assume that $u \neq \pm 1$ mod squares. 

\begin{theorem}\label{T:quarticM} 
Let $p > 2$ be a prime. Let $K$ a number field with $\sqrt{-1} \not\in K$ and let also $u \in K$ satisfy $u \neq \pm 1$ mod squares. 
Let $E/K$ be an elliptic and $E'/K$
its quartic twist by~$u$.
Assume $E$ and~$E'$ are $p$-congruent.
Then $E[p]$ and~$E'[p]$ are symplectically isomorphic if and only if
$\sqrt{p^*} \in K$ or $u = p^*$ mod squares.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} 
We have $j=j'=1728$ and the curves have~CM by $\Q(\sqrt{-1})$. We have $\PP \rhobar_{E,p} \simeq D_4$ by Lemma~?? and, since $u \neq -4$ mod 4th powers, by Lemma~\ref{L:LinF} the projective $p$-division field is $F = K(\sqrt{-1},\root 4 \of u)$

The group~$D_4$ has three normal subgroups of order~$4$: one cyclic corresponding to the projective image of $G_{K(\sqrt{-1})}$ and two isomorphic to~$C_2 \times C_2$ corresponding to the projective images of
$G_{K(\sqrt{u})}$ and $G_{K(\sqrt{-u})}$.

Let $M = K(\sqrt{u})$. 
The base change of~$E$ and~$E'$  
to~$M$ are quadratic twists by~$\sqrt{u}$ from the discussion preceeding the theorem. They are also $p$-congruent and,  since the 
symplectic type is preserved by this base change, we can apply Theorem~\ref{T:quadratic} over~$M$.  
Indeed, from its part~(2) we know that
$E[p]$ and~$E'[p]$ are symplectically isomorphic if and only if $\sqrt{p^*} \in M$ 
or $E/M$ and $E'/M$ are quadratic twists by~$\sqrt{p^*}$. 
This latter condition means $u = p^*$ mod squares and since $M = K(\sqrt{u})$ the result follows.
\end{proof}

For the case of cubic and sextic twists we need some auxiliary results first. 

\begin{lemma} \label{L:PsiInImage}
Let~$E$ and~$E'$ be non-trivial cubic or sextic twists. 
Fix basis for $E[p]$ and~$E'[p]$ as above so that the matrix equality \eqref{E:PsiMatrix} holds. Assume $E$ and $E'$ are $p$-congruent.

Then 
$\rhobar_{E,p}(G_K) = \rhobar_{E',p}(G_K)$ 
as subgroups of~$\GL_2(\F_p)$. In particular, the common image contains $\{ \Psi_\sigma \}_{\sigma \in G_K}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
Let~$E$ and~$E'$ be non-trivial cubic or sextic twists. Assume they are $p$-congruent. 

Then $\PP\rhobar_{E,p}(G_K)$ is either $D_3$ or~$D_6$, where the later case only occur for sextic twists.
\end{lemma}


\begin{theorem}\label{T:cubicM} 
Let $K$ be a number field with $\sqrt{-3} \not\in K$. 
Let $E'/K$ be a cubic or sextic twist of~$E/K$ by~$u \in K$ with $u \neq -3$ mod squares. Assume $E[p] \cong E'[p]$
and $\PP \rhobar_{E,p} \simeq D_3$.
Then $E[p]$ and~$E'[p]$ are symplectically isomorphic if and only if
$\sqrt{p^*} \in K$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} We have $j=j'=0$ and the curves have~CM by $\Q(\sqrt{-3})$.

By hypothesis $\psi(\sigma) \neq 1$ for some~$\sigma \in G_K$ therefore, 
considering~\eqref{E:PsiM} projectively, we see that~$M$ acts as a non-trivial automorphism of~$D_3$ by Lemma~\ref{L:PsiInImage}.
Since all automorphisms of~$D_3$ are inner, 
there is $\tau \in G_K$ such that 
$M = \rhobar_{E,p}(\tau) \neq \Id$ in~$\PGL_2(\F_p)$.

If $\Psi_\tau \neq \Id$, then   
taking~$\sigma = \tau$ in~\eqref{E:PsiM} 
gives
$\rhobar_{E,p}(\tau) = \rhobar_{E,p}(\tau) \cdot \Psi_\tau$, a contradiction. We conclude that
$\tau \in G_{K(\root3\of{u})}$. 
Moreover, by hypothesis
$F = K(\sqrt{-3},\root3\of{u})$ is
the field cut out by $\PP \rhobar_{E,p}$. 
Thus $\tau(\sqrt{-3}) = - \sqrt{-3}$.

Recall that $\sqrt{p^*} \in F$.
Thus $\sqrt{p^*} \in K(\sqrt{-3})$, so either $\sqrt{p^*} \in K$ or $\sqrt{-3p^*} \in K$. In the first case, clearly $\tau(\sqrt{p^*}) = \sqrt{p^*}$; in the second, we have 
\[
 \tau(\sqrt{p^*}) = \tau(\sqrt{-3}\cdot\sqrt{-3p^*}) = \tau(\sqrt{-3}) \cdot \tau(\sqrt{-3p^*})= - \sqrt{-3} \cdot \sqrt{-3p^*} = - \sqrt{p^*}
\]
and we conclude that $\det \rhobar_{E,p}(\tau)$ is a square if and only if~$\sqrt{p^*} \in K$. Clearly the same holds for~$M$ and the result follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{T:sexticM} 
Let $K$ be a number field with $\sqrt{-3} \not\in K$. 
Let $E'/K$ be the sextic twist of~$E/K$ by~$u \in K$ with $u \neq -3$ mod squares. 
Assume $E[p] \simeq E'[p]$
and $\PP \rhobar_{E,p} \simeq D_6$.
Then $E[p]$ and~$E'[p]$ are symplectically isomorphic if and only if
$\sqrt{p^*} \in K$ or $u = p^*$ mod squares.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}   
We have $j=j'=0$ so that the curves have~CM by $\Q(\sqrt{-3})$. 

Recall the field $F$ cut out by $\PP \rhobar_{E,p}$ 
contains $K(\sqrt{-3})$ 
and $K(\sqrt{u})$ by Lemma~\ref{L:LinF}; 
hence it also contains $K(\sqrt{-3u})$ and these thre extensions are different.


The group~$D_6$ has three normal subgroups of order~$6$: one cyclic corresponding to the projective image of $G_{K(\sqrt{-3})}$ and two isomorphic to~$D_3$ corresponding to the projective images of
$G_{K(\sqrt{u})}$ and $G_{K(\sqrt{-3u})}$.
Moreover, the base change of~$E$ and~$E'$ 
to~$K(\sqrt{u})$ are cubic twists. Since the 
symplectic type is preserved by base change 
to~$K(\sqrt{u})$, we can apply Proposition~\ref{T:cubicM} over this field.
Indeed, over~$K(\sqrt{u})$ we have that $E[p]$ and~$E'[p]$ are symplectically isomorphic if and only if
$\sqrt{p^*} \in K(\sqrt{u})$, that is when
$\sqrt{p^*} \in K$ or $K(\sqrt{u}) = K(\sqrt{p^*})$, as desired.
\end{proof}


\section{Auxiliary results for the reducible case}

Some of the mod~$7$ congruences 
$E[7] \simeq E'[7]$ in the LMFDB database occur 
when these Galois modules are reducible. Compared to the irreducible case, establishing reducible congruences requires extra work because when working with the semisimplifications $E[7]^{ss}$ and $E'[7]^{ss}$ important information is lost.
The objective of this section is to establish Theorem~\ref{T:reducible} which will allow us to rigorously prove congruences in the reducible case.


Let $B \subset \GL_2(\F_p)$ be the standard Borel subgroup, i.e. the
upper triangular matrices. Let $H \subset B$ be a subgroup of order
divisible by~$p$.  We can write~$H = D\cdot U$ where $D \subset B$ is
a subgroup of diagonal matrices and $U$ is cyclic generated by
$\left(\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1
                            \end{smallmatrix} \right)$.   
Moreover, $U$ is a normal subgroup of~$H$ 
and we write $\pi : H \to H/U \simeq D$ for the quotient map.

\begin{proposition} \label{P:inner}
Let $H = D \cdot U \subset B$ and $\pi$ be as above. 
Let $\phi$ be an automorphism of~$H$. Assume that  
$\pi(x) = \pi(\phi(x))$ for all $x \in H$. 

Then $\phi$ is given by conjugation in $B$, i.e. there is $A \in B$ such that $\phi(x) = AxA^{-1}$. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $x \in H$ and write it as $x = du$ with $d \in D, u \in U$.
Note that $U$ is the unique normal subgroup with order~$p$, so 
$\phi(U) = U$ and $\phi(D)=D$ for all $\phi \in \Aut H$.
By hypothesis, we have 
\[
 \pi(x) = \pi(\phi(x)) = \pi(\phi(d))\pi(\phi(u)) \iff dU = \phi(d)U
 \iff d\phi(d)^{-1} \in U.
\]
Since $d, \phi(d) \in D$ we have $d\phi(d)^{-1} \in D \cap U = \{ I_2\}$ therefore $d\phi(d)^{-1} = I_2$, where $I_2$ is the identity in $\GL_2(\F_p)$.
Thus $d = \phi(d)$ and we conclude that any $\phi$ 
as in the statement is the same as an automorphism of~$U$ (extended to~$H$ by $\phi(d)=d$ for all $d\in D$). 

Write $N_B(U)$  for the normaliser of $U$ in $B$ and $C_B(U)$ for its centralizer. 
We have $N_B(U) = B$ 
and $C_B(U)$ are the matrices of the form $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
                            \lambda & b \\
                            0 & \lambda
                            \end{smallmatrix} \right)$
with $\lambda \neq 0$. Thus $\# N_B(U)/C_B(U) = p-1$. 
Since  we also have 
\[
 N_B(U)/C_B(U) \hookrightarrow \Aut U \simeq \F_p^*
\]
it follows that $\Aut U \simeq N_B(U)/C_B(U)$, as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition} \label{P:fieldF}
Let $p > 2$ be a prime. Let $E/K$ be an elliptic curve such that 
$\rhobar_{E,p}$ is reducible. Assume there is an element of order~$p$ 
in the image of~$\rhobar_{E,p}$. 

Then, there is a field $F \supset K$ such that $[F : K] = p$ and $E$ acquires a 
second isogeny over~$F$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof} We can choose a basis of $E[p]$ where
\[
\rhobar_{E,p} =  \begin{pmatrix}
                            \chi& h \\
                            0 & \chi'
                            \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Let $H$ be the set of elements $\sigma \in  G_K$ such 
that $h(\sigma) = 0$. Since $\rhobar_{E,p}$ is a homomorphism it follows 
that $H$ is a subgroup of $G_K$. 
We let $F \subset K(E[p])$ to be the field fixed by $H$.
Since there is an element of order~$p$ in the image of~$\rhobar_{E,p}$ and 
$\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
                            \chi & 0 \\
                            0 & \chi'
                            \end{smallmatrix} \right)$
has order coprime to~$p$, 
it follows that $[F : K] =p$.
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem} \label{T:reducible}
Let $p > 2$ be a prime. Let $E_1, E_2$ be elliptic curves 
over~$K$ such that 
\begin{itemize}
 \item[(i)] $\rhobar_{E_1,p}^{ss} \simeq \rhobar_{E_2,p}^{ss} \simeq \chi \oplus \chi'$,  where $\chi, \chi' : G_K \to \F_p^*$ are characters;
 \item[(ii)] both $\rhobar_{E_1,p}$ and $\rhobar_{E_2,p}$ have an element of
 order~$p$ in their image.
\end{itemize}
For $i=1,2$, let $F_i/K$ be a degree~$p$ extension where $E_i$
acquires a second isogeny, as given by Proposition~\ref{P:fieldF}.

After replacing $E_2$ by a $p$-isogenous curve if necessary, we have
$\rhobar_{E_1,p} \simeq \rhobar_{E_2,p}$ if and only if $F_1 \simeq
F_2$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} Clearly, 
if $\rhobar_{E_1,p} \simeq \rhobar_{E_2,p}$ 
then $F_1 \simeq F_2$. We now prove the opposite direction.

From (i) it follows that $\rhobar_{E_i,p}$ is reducible and that, after replacing $E_2$ by a $p$-isogenous curve if necessary (to swap 
$\chi$ with $\chi'$), 
we have 
\[
\rhobar_{E_i,p} =  \begin{pmatrix}
                            \chi & h_i \\
                            0 & \chi'
                            \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{ with } \quad  h_i : G_K \to \F_p.  
\]
Let $L$ be the field cut out 
by $\chi \oplus \chi'$. 
It follows from (ii) that $h_i|_{G_L} \neq 0$, and
hence the matrix $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
                            1 & 1 \\
                            0 & 1
                            \end{smallmatrix} \right)$  
is in the image of $\rhobar_{E_i,p}$ for $i=1,2$.
                            
Write $K_i = K(E_i[p])$. 
We have $[K_i : K] = [K_i : L][L : K] = p [L : K]$. 
Since the degree $[L : K]$ divides $(p-1)^2$ it is coprime 
to $p = [F_i : K]$ therefore we have $K_i = L F_i$.

Suppose $F_1 \simeq F_2$. Since $K_1$ is Galois, we have $F_2 \subset K_1$ and therefore $K_p := K_1 = K_2$ is the field cut out by both
$\rhobar_{E_1,p}$ and $\rhobar_{E_2,p}$, i.e. these representations have the same kernel.

Write $G = \Gal(K_p / K)$. From now on we think of $\rhobar_{E_i,p}$ as an injective representation of~$G$. Note that the images of $\rhobar_{E_1,p}$ and $\rhobar_{E_2,p}$
is the same subgroup~$H$ of the Borel.

All the elements in $H$ are of the form $\rhobar_{E_2,p}(\sigma)$ for $\sigma \in G$, so we can consider the map $\phi = \rhobar_{E_1,p} \circ \rhobar_{E_2,p}^{-1} : H \to H$. It is an automorphism of~$H = D\cdot U$ satisfying the hypothesis of Proposition~\ref{P:inner}, where $D$ are 
the matrices $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
                            \chi & 0 \\
                            0 & \chi'
                            \end{smallmatrix} \right)$.  
Then, $\phi$ is given by conjugation, that is
\[
 \phi(\rhobar_{E_2,p}(\sigma)) = A \rhobar_{E_2,p}(\sigma) A^{-1}.
\]
Since we also have
\[ 
\phi(\rhobar_{E_2,p}(\sigma)) 
=  \rhobar_{E_1,p} \circ \rhobar_{E_2,p}^{-1}(\rhobar_{E_2,p}(\sigma)) = \rhobar_{E_1,p}(\sigma)
\]
we conclude that $\rhobar_{E_1,p}(\sigma) = A \rhobar_{E_2,p}(\sigma) A^{-1}$, as desired.
\end{proof}

\section{Finding congruences and determining their symplectic type}\label{S:statistics}

In this section we discuss our systematic study of mod~$p$ congruences
between elliptic curves in the LMFDB database.  As of April 2019, this
database contains all elliptic curves defined over~$\Q$ of
conductor~$N\le\numprint{400000}$, as computed by the first author
using the methods of~\cite{AMEC}; there are $\numprint{2483649}$
curves, in $\numprint{1741002}$ isogeny classes.


Recall first that isogenous curves have mod~$p$ representations which
are isomorphic up to semisimplification, and actually isomorphic if
the degree of the isogeny is not divisible by~$p$.  Secondly, two
representations have isomorphic semisimplification if and only if they
have the same traces, so that we can test this condition by testing
whether
\[ a_{\ell}(E)\equiv a_{\ell}(E')\pmod{p}
\quad \text{for all primes } \ell \nmid pNN',
\] 
where $N$ and $N'$ are the conductors of $E$
and~$E'$ respectively.  This test can very quickly establish rigorously
that two curves do \emph{not} have isomorphic $p$-torsion up to
semisimplification, by finding  a single
prime~$\ell$ such that $a_{\ell}(E)\not\equiv a_{\ell}(E')\pmod{p}$.
Moreover, it is possible to prove that two curves have isomorphic $p$-torsion up to
semisimplification using this test for a finite number of
primes~$\ell$, as we explain in Step 2 below.

We divide our procedure to determine all mod~$p$ congruences between
non-isogenous curves, and their symplectic type, for a fixed
prime~$p$, into five steps.  We first outline the steps, and then
consider each in detail in the following subsections.
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Partition the set of isogeny classes of elliptic curves in LMFDB
  into subsets~$S$, such that whenever two curves have mod~$p$
  representations with isomorphic semisimplifications, their isogeny
  classes belong to the same subset~$S$, but not necessarily
  conversely.
\item For each subset~$S$ prove that the curves in each isogeny class in~$S$ really
  do have isomorphic mod~$p$ representations up to
  semisimplification, if necessary further partitioning the subsets.
  Discard all ``trivial'' subsets of size~$1$.
\item Separate the remaining subsets resulting from the previous
  step into those which have irreducible mod~$p$ representations and
  the reducible ones.
\item For each irreducible subset~$S$, and each pair of isogeny
  classes in~$S$, pick curves $E$ and~$E'$, one from each class in the
  pair; determine the symplectic type of the triple~$(E,E',p)$; then
  use the isogeny criterion to partition the set of all the curves in
  all the isogeny classes in~$S$ into one or two parts such that curves
  in the same part are symplectically isomorphic while those in
  different parts are antisymplectically isomorphic.
\item For each reducible subset~$S$, determine whether, for each pair
  $E$, $E'$ chosen as in Step 4, there is an isomorphism between
  $E[p]$ and $E'[p]$ and not just between their semisimplifications,
  if necessary replacing $E'$ with the curve $p$-isogenous to it.  If
  not, this means that $E[p]$ and $E'[p]$ are not in fact isomorphic.
  Thus we further partition each reducible set $S$ into subsets of
  isogeny classes of curves whose mod~$p$ representations are actually
  isomorphic, not just up to semisimplification.  For each of these
  new subsets, if nontrivial, proceed as in Step~4.

\end{enumerate}
Next we will explain each step in further detail.  For the first three
steps, $p$ is arbitrary, and we have carried these steps out for $7\le
p\le97$.  According to Theorem~\ref{T:cong19} below, no congruences
(other than those induced by isogenies) exist for larger~$p$.  For the
last two steps, we restrict to $p=7$ which is the most interesting
case, as remarked in the Introduction.


\subsection{Sieving}
In order that $E[p]\cong E'[p]$ up to semisimplification, it is
necessary and sufficient that for all primes~$\ell$ not dividing
$pNN'$ we have $a_{\ell}(E)\equiv a_{\ell}(E')\pmod{p}$.  In this step
we may take one curve from each isogeny class, since isogenous curves
have the same traces~$a_\ell$, and have mod~$p$ representations with
isomorphic semisimplifications.

Fix an integer~$B\ge1$.  Let $\calL_B$ be the set of the $B$ smallest
primes greater than $\numprint{400000}$. All curves in the database
have good reduction at each prime in~$\calL_B$.  Assume also $B$ is
large enough that $p\notin\calL_B$.  Hence a necessary condition for
two curves $E$ and $E'$ in the database to be congruent mod~$p$ is
that $a_{\ell}(E)\equiv a_{\ell}(E')\pmod{p}$ for all~$\ell\in\calL_B$.

To each curve $E$ in the database we assign a ``hash value'' which is
a simple function of the set $\{a_{\ell}(E)\pmod{p}\mid
\ell\in\calL_B\}$.  For example we may enumerate
$\calL_B=\{\ell_0,\ell_1,\dots,\ell_{B-1}\}$ and use the integer value
$\sum_{i=0}^{B-1}\overline{a}_{\ell_i}(E)p^i$, where for $a\in\Z$,
$\overline{a}$ denotes the reduction of $a$ mod~$p$ which lies in
$\{0,1,\dots,p-1\}$.  Curves whose mod~$p$ representations are
isomorphic up to semisimplification will have the same hash, and we
may hope that clashes will be rare if $B$ is not too small.

We proceed to compute this hash value for one curve in each isogeny
class in the database, recording the curve's label in a list indexed
by the different hash values encountered.  At the end of this step we
can easily form a partition of the set of isogeny classes by taking
these lists for each hash value.  We then discard any such lists which
are singletons.  Using $B=40$, this process takes approximately 40
minutes for a single prime~$p$.  Note, however, that as most of the
computation time taken is in computing $a_{\ell}(E)$ for all
curves~$E$ (up to isogeny), it is more efficient to compute the hash
values for several primes in parallel.

{\bf Example.} After carrying out this step for $7\le p\le17$, using
$B=40$, we find: $\numprint{20138}$ nontrivial subsets for $p=7$;
$635$ for $p=11$; $150$ for $p=13$; and~$8$ for $p=17$.  There are no
nontrivial subsets for any primes~$p$ with $19\le p\le97$, so we can
immediately conclude that there are no congruences in the database
between non-isogenous curves modulo any prime in this range.  See also
Theorem~\ref{T:cong19} below.

\subsection{Proving isomorphism up to semisimplification}

For each pair of isogeny classes within one subset obtained in the
previous step, we use a criterion of Kraus--Oesterl\'e (see
\cite[Proposition~4]{KO}), based on the Sturm bound and hence on the
modularity of elliptic curves over~$\Q$, to either prove isomorphism
up to semisimplification, or reveal a ``false positive''.  The latter
would happen if two curves which are not congruent mod~$p$ have traces
of Frobenius~$a_{\ell}$ which are congruent modulo~$p$ for
all~$\ell\in\calL_B$.

{\bf Example (continued).}  For $7\le p\le17$ we find no such false
positives, so the curves within each subset do have mod~$p$
representations which are genuinely isomorphic up to
semisimplification.

\begin{remark}
  To avoid false positives, it is necessary to use a value of $B$
  which is at least~$36$, for the following reason.  The curves with
  labels \lmfdbec{25921}{a}{1} and \lmfdbec{78400}{gw}{1} have traces
  $a_{\ell}$ which are \emph{equal for all~$\ell\in\calL_{35}$}, that
  is, for all~$\ell$ with $400000\le \ell<400457$ (though not for
  $\ell=400457$).  These curves have CM by the order of
  discriminant~$-7$, and are quadratic twists by~$230$; both have
  $a_\ell=0$ for all $\ell\equiv3,5,6\pmod{7}$, and $230$ is a
  quadratic residue modulo all other primes in~$\calL_{35}$. In our
  first computational runs, we used $B=30$ and discovered this pair of
  curves giving rise to a false positive for every~$p$.
\end{remark}

The sizes of the subsets of isogeny classes we find after the first
two steps are as follows: for $p=7$ the~$\numprint{20138}$ subsets
have sizes between~$2$ and~$76$; for $p=11$, $p=13$ and $p=17$ they
all have size~$2$.


\subsection{Testing reducibility}
For each set of isogeny classes of curves obtained in the previous
step, we next determine whether the curves in the set have irreducible
or reducible mod~$p$ representations.  To do this we apply a standard
test of whether an elliptic curve admits a rational $p$-isogeny.  For
the curves in the database this information is already known.

{\bf Example (continued).} For $p=7$, of the $\numprint{20138}$
nontrivial sets from Step~2, we find that $\numprint{19883}$ are
irreducible, {\it i.e.}\@ consist of curves whose mod~$7$
representations are irreducible, while $255$ are reducible.

The irreducible sets have size at most~$5$.  In detail, there are
$\numprint{18334}$ sets of size~2; $\numprint{1297}$ sets of size~3;
246 sets of size~4; and 6 sets of size~5.

The reducible sets have size up to~$76$.  In Step~5 below we will
further partition these sets after testing whether the curves are
actually congruent mod~7 (not just up to semisimplification), after
which the largest subset has only~$4$ isogeny classes.

%% Reducible {2: 86, 3: 67, 4: 31, 5: 26, 7: 7, 10: 6, 6: 5, 8: 5, 9: 4, 19: 4, 11:
%%   3, 16: 2, 18: 2, 32: 1, 35: 1, 76: 1, 13: 1, 14: 1, 45: 1, 36: 1}

For $p=11, 13$, and~$17$, all the nontrivial subsets are of size~$2$,
and all are irreducible.

\subsection{Distinguishing symplectic from antisymplectic: irreducible case}
After the previous step we have a collection of sets of isogeny
classes, such that for each pair of curves $E$, $E'$ taken from
isogeny classes in each set, the $G_{\Q}$-modules $E[p]$ and $E'[p]$
are isomorphic and irreducible. Moreover, from
Proposition~\ref{P:auto} we know that all isomorphisms $\phi : E[p]
\simeq E'[p]$ have the same symplectic type. We wish to determine
whether this type is symplectic or anti-symplectic.  We may assume
that $E$ and~$E'$ are not isogenous, as otherwise we may simply apply
the isogeny criterion.

The local criteria of \cite{FKSym} suffice to determine the symplectic
type for all the mod~$p$ congruences found in the database for $p=7$
and $p=11$ (and also for $p=13, 17$), but this does not have to be
the case as discussed in Section~\ref{S:motivation} (see
\cite[Proposition~16]{FKSym} for an example with $p=3$ where the local
methods fail).  Therefore, we will now describe a procedure, using the
modular curves~$X_E(7)$, to obtain a method that works in all cases.
We will use the modular parametrizations and explicit formulae of
Kraus--Halberstadt~\cite{Halberstadt-Kraus-XE7},
Poonen--Schaefer--Stoll~\cite{PSS}, and as extended and completed by
Fisher~\cite{Fisher}.

In~\cite{Halberstadt-Kraus-XE7}, Halberstadt and Kraus give an
explicit model for the modular curve $X_E(7)$, for any elliptic curve
$E$ defined over a field~$K$ of characteristic not equal to $2$, $3$
or~$7$. Recall that the $K$-rational points on $X_E(7)$ parametrize
pairs $(E',\phi)$ where $E'$ is an elliptic curve defined over~$K$ and
$\phi:E[7]\to E'[7]$ is a symplectic isomorphism of $G_K$-modules; we
identify two such isomorphisms~$\phi$ when one is a scalar multiple of
the other.

The model for $X_E(7)$ given in \cite{Halberstadt-Kraus-XE7} is a
plane quartic curve, a twist of the classical Klein quartic~$X(7)$,
given by an explicit ternary quartic form~$F_{a,b}(X,Y,Z)$ in
$\Z[a,b][X,Y,Z]$ where $E$ has equation $Y^2=X^3+aX+b$.  The $24$
flexes on $X_E(7)$ are the cusps, that is, they are the poles of the
rational function of degree~$168$ giving the map $j:X_E(7)\to
X(1)$.
%% The $28$ bitangents intersect $X_E(7)$ at the 56
%% points above $j=0$: these are the intersection points of $X_E(7)$ and
%% the curve of degree~$14$ defined by a covariant of~$F_{a,b}$.

The base point $P_E=[0:1:0]\in X_E(7)(K)$ corresponds to the pair
$(E,\id)$.  In \cite{Halberstadt-Kraus-XE7} one can also find explicit formulas
for the rational function $j:X_E(7)\to X(1)$ and for the elliptic curve~$E'$
associated with all 
but finitely many points $P=(x:y:z)\in
X_E(7)$. More precisely, 
explicit polynomials $c_4, c_6 \in \Z[a,b][X,Y,Z]$
of degree~$20$ and~$30$, respectively, are given and the curve $E'$ associated with (all but finitely many)~$P$ has model
\[Y^2=X^3-27c_4(P)X-54c_6(P).\]

The finitely many common zeros of $c_4$
and $c_6$ are the exceptions, which Kraus and Halberstadt treat only
incompletely.  However, in \cite{Fisher} one may find formulas for
four such pairs of polynomials~$(c_4,c_6)$, of which the first is the pair in
\cite{Halberstadt-Kraus-XE7}, and such that at each point $P\in
X_E(7)$ at least one pair $(c_4(P),c_6(P))\not=(0,0)$, thus supplying
us with a model for the associated elliptic 
curve~$E'$ at each point~$P$.

We make use of this model and formulas as follows, given curves $E$,
$E'$ with $E[7]\cong E'[7]$.  Using one curve~$E$ we write down the
model for $X_E(7)$.  Then we find all preimages (if any) of $j'=j(E')$
under the map $X_E(7)\to X(1)$.  While over an algebraically closed
field there are $168$ distinct preimages of each $j'$, except that the
ramification points $j=0$ and $j=1728$ have $56$ and $84$ preimages,
over $\Q$, by Theorem~\ref{T:Cartan} there are at most two, except
for $j'=0$ when there may be four.

If there are no preimages of~$j'$, we conclude that the isomorphism
$E[7]\cong E'[7]$ is not symplectic.  Otherwise, for each preimage
$P\in X_E(7)(\Q)$ we compute the curve associated to~$P$, which may be
a twist of~$E'$, and test whether it is actually isomorphic to $E'$.
If this holds for one such point~$P$ in the preimage of $j(E')$, then
the isomorphism between $E[7]$ and $E'[7]$ is symplectic.

A similar method may be applied to test for antisymplectic
isomorphisms, using another twist of $X(7)$ denoted $X_E^-(7)$, first
written down explicitly in \cite{PSS}, for which Fisher provides
explicit formulae for the $j$-map and $c_4,c_6$ as above
in~\cite{Fisher}.

We note that it is not necessary to apply both the symplectic and
antisymplectic tests to a triple $(E,E',7)$ if we know already that
$E[7]\cong E'[7]$ as $G_\Q$-modules, since one will succeed if and only if the other
fails (by Proposition~\ref{P:auto}).  However we did apply both
tests in our computations with the curves in the database as a test of
our implementation, verifying that precisely one test passes for each
pair.  We also checked that the results obtained for each pair using
the local criteria are the same, so that we can be confident in the
correctness of the results.

These tests have only been carried out using a single curve in each
isogeny class, since we know how to distinguish symplectic from
antisymplectic isogenies.  As a last step, we consider the full isogeny classes
to obtain, for each elliptic curve~$E$ in the database, the complete sets of all curves~$E'$ (non-isogenous to~$E$) which have
symplectically and anti-symplectically isomorphic $7$-torsion modules to~$E$.

The output of this step consists of, for each of the subsets resulting
from Steps~1--3, one or two sets of curves whose union is the set of
all curves in the isogeny classes in the subset.  All curves in the
same set have symplectically isomorphic 7-torsion modules; when there
are two sets, curves in different sets have antisymplectically
isomorphic 7-torsion.

{\bf Example (continued).}
Of the $\numprint{19883}$ non-trivial sets of isogeny classes with mutually
isomorphic irreducible mod~$7$ representations, we find that in
$\numprint{12394}$ cases all the isomorphisms are symplectic, while in the
remaining $\numprint{7489}$ cases antisymplectic isomorphisms occur.

Using the local criteria of \cite{FKSym} for $p=11, 13, 17$ we find:
for $p=11$, of the $635$ congruent pairs of isogeny classes, $446$ are
symplectic and $189$ are antisymplectic; for $p=13$, of the $150$
congruent pairs of isogeny classes, $88$ are symplectic and $62$ are
antisymplectic; for $p=17$, all of the $8$ congruent pairs of isogeny
classes are antisymplectic.

\begin{example}
Let $p=7$.  One of the subsets resulting from Steps 1--3 consists of
the pair of isogeny classes $\{\lmfdbec{344025}{bc}{1},
\lmfdbec{344025}{bd}{1}\}$.  Our test shows that
$\lmfdbec{344025}{bc}{1}$ and $\lmfdbec{344025}{bd}{1}$ are
symplectically isomorphic.  The isogeny class
$\lmfdbeciso{344025}{bc}$ contains two $2$-isogenous curves, while
class $\lmfdbeciso{344025}{bd}$ contains only one curve.  Since $2$ is
a quadratic residue mod~7, all three curves have symplectically
isomorphic 7-torsion, and hence Step~4 returns a single set
\[\{\lmfdbec{344025}{bc}{1}, \lmfdbec{344025}{bc}{2}, \lmfdbec{344025}{bd}{1}\}.\]
Another subset resulting from Steps 1--3 is
$\{\lmfdbec{100800}{gw}{1}, \lmfdbec{100800}{hc}{1}\}$.  The same
procedure results in the output of two sets of curves
\[
\{\lmfdbec{100800}{gw}{1}\}, \qquad \{\lmfdbec{100800}{hc}{1},
\lmfdbec{100800}{hc}{2}\},
\]
since our tests show that $\lmfdbec{100800}{gw}{1}$ and
$\lmfdbec{100800}{hc}{1}$ are antisymplectically isomorphic, and the
last two curves are $2$-isogenous.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Consider the set of six elliptic curves
\[\{\lmfdbec{9225}{a}{1}, \lmfdbec{9225}{e}{1}, \lmfdbec{225}{a}{1},
\lmfdbec{225}{a}{2}, \lmfdbec{11025}{c}{1}, \lmfdbec{11025}{c}{2}\}\]
which form four
complete isogeny classes.  All have isomorphic mod~7 representations
with image the normaliser of a split Cartan subgroup.  The last four
curves all have $j$-invariant~$0$ and CM by $-3$.  The first two are
$-3$-twists of each other.

The general methods of Step~4 of this section split this set into two
subsets:
\[
  \{\lmfdbec{9225}{a}{1}, \lmfdbec{225}{a}{1},
  \lmfdbec{11025}{c}{1}\},\qquad \{\lmfdbec{9225}{e}{1},
  \lmfdbec{225}{a}{2}, \lmfdbec{11025}{c}{2}\}
\]
Curves $\lmfdbec{9225}{a}{1}$ and $\lmfdbec{9225}{e}{1}$ give a non-CM
example of  Theorem~\ref{T:Cartan}.  Curves  $\lmfdbec{225}{a}{1}$ and
$\lmfdbec{11025}{c}{1}$ are sextic (but  not quadratic or cubic) twists
and illustrate Theorem~\ref{T:j=0}.
\end{example}

\subsection{Distinguishing symplectic from antisymplectic: reducible
  case}

One additional complication arises in this case.  Indeed, from Steps
1--3 we have $E[7]^{\sss} \simeq E'[7]^{\sss}$ but this is
insufficient to conclude $E[7] \simeq E'[7]$ when these are reducible
$G_\Q$-modules.  To achieve this we will apply
Theorem~\ref{T:reducible} and its proof.

Recall that $E[7]$ is reducible if and only if $E$ admits a rational
$7$-isogeny.  Over $\Q$ there is only ever at most one $7$-isogeny,
since otherwise the image of the mod~$7$
representation~$\rhobar_{E,7}$ attached to~$E$ is contained in a split
Cartan subgroup of $\GL(2,\F_7)$, and this cannot occur over~$\Q$
(see~\cite[Theorem~1.1]{GL}).  Furthermore, it is well known that the
size of the $\Q$-isogeny class of~$E$ is either $2$, consisting of two
$7$-isogenous curves, or $4$, consisting of two pairs of $7$-isogenous
curves linked by $2$-{} or $3$-isogenies (but not both). Examples of
these are furnished by the isogeny classes \lmfdbeciso{26}{b},
\lmfdbeciso{49}{a}, and \lmfdbeciso{162}{b} respectively.

Fix an elliptic curve $E$ with $E[7]$ reducible. 
The image
of~$\rhobar_{E,7}$ has the form
\[
  \begin{pmatrix}\chi_1&*\\0&\chi_2  \end{pmatrix},
\]
where~$\chi_1, \; \chi_2 : G_{\Q}\to\F_7^*$ are characters and $*$
(the upper right entry) is non-zero by the previous
discussion. Moreover, the product $\chi_1\chi_2$ is the cyclotomic
character, so in particular $\chi_1\not=\chi_2$. This last observation
is valid over any field not containing $\sqrt{-7}$, so that the
determinant is not always a square.

Now let $E'$ be a second curve such that $E[7]^{\sss}\cong
E'[7]^{\sss}$. 
The image of $\rhobar_{E',7}$ has the form
\[
  \begin{pmatrix}\chi_1'&*'\\0&\chi_2'  \end{pmatrix},
  \]
where $\{\chi_1,\chi_2\}=\{\chi_1',\chi_2'\}$ and $*' \neq 0$ for the
same reason as before.  In particular, there is an element of
order~$7$ in the images of both $\rhobar_{E,7}$ and $\rhobar_{E',7}$.
The next step in applying Theorem~\ref{T:reducible} is to decide if we
need to replace $E'$ with its $7$-isogenous curve to obtain
$\chi_1=\chi_1'$ and $\chi_2=\chi_2'$. For this we determine the
``isogeny characters'' characters $\chi_1$ and $\chi_1'$: the kernel
of $\chi_1$ (respectively $\chi_1'$) cuts out the cyclic extension
of~$\Q$ of degree dividing~$6$ generated by the coordinates of a point
in the kernel of the unique $7$-isogeny from~$E$ (respectively~$E'$).
In this way we can determine whether $\chi_1=\chi_1'$ and
$\chi_2=\chi_2'$ or $\chi_1=\chi_2'$ and $\chi_2=\chi_1'$.  In the
second case, we replace $E'$ with its $7$-isogenous curve, which has
the effect of interchanging $\chi_1'$ and~$\chi_2'$ (as well as
changing $*'$).  Now the image of $\rhobar_{E',7}$ has the form
\[
\begin{pmatrix}\chi_1&*'\\0&\chi_2  \end{pmatrix},
\]
with the same characters, in the same order, as for
$\rhobar_{E,7}$. From Theorem~\ref{T:reducible} we have that
$E[7]\cong E'[7]$ if and only if $F_1 \simeq F_2$, where $F_i$ are the
fields in the statement of Theorem~\ref{T:reducible}.

%{\bf Although the maps $*,*':G_{\Q}\to\F_7$ are not homomorphisms, it is
%easy to check that they are both surjective and that the subsets of
%$G_{\Q}$ which map to~$0$ under each (which by abuse of language we
%will call the \emph{kernels} of~$*$ and~$*'$) are subgroups, of
%index~$7$ and cutting out cyclic extensions} of~$\Q$ of degree~$7$.

The field $F_1$ is the common field of definition of all of the other
seven $7$-isogenies from~$E$ (see also Proposition~\ref{P:fieldF}).
The map from $X_0(7)$ to the $j$-line is given by the classical
rational function (see Fricke)
\[
   j = \frac{(t^{2} + 13t + 49) \cdot (t^{2} + 5t + 1)^{3}}{t},
\]
where $t$ is a choice of Hauptmodul for the genus~$0$ curve
$X_0(7)$. Hence the roots of the degree~$8$ polynomial~$(t^{2} + 13t +
49) \cdot (t^{2} + 5t + 1)^{3} -t\cdot j(E)$ determine the fields of
definition of the eight $7$-isogenies from~$E$. In our setting, it has
a single rational root (giving the unique $7$-isogeny from~$E$ defined
over~$\Q$) and an irreducible factor of degree~$7$, which
defines~$F_1$ as an extension of~$\Q$. Similarly, starting from $E'$
we determine $F_2$; finally, we check whether $F_1$ and $F_2$ are
isomorphic.

%the desired extension of the base
%field~$\Q$, which in turn  uniquely identifies the $*$ component of the
%representation, by Theorem~\ref{T:reducible}.

In this way, for each pair $(E,E')$ whose 
mod~$7$ representations
are reducible with isomorphic semisimplifications, we may determine
whether or not we do in fact have an isomorphism $E[7]\cong E'[7]$,
possibly after replacing $E'$ by its unique $7$-isogenous curve.

In most of the reducible cases encountered in the database, we found
that there was no isomorphism between the $7$-torsion modules
themselves.  In those cases where there is such an isomorphism, we can
determine whether or not it is symplectic using the same methods as in
the irreducible case, noting that the test using the parametrizing
curves $X_E(7)$ and $X_E^-(7)$ do not at any point rely on the
irreducibility or otherwise of the representations.  Finally, if there
are also $2$-{} or $3$-isogenies present we can include these
appropriately, since the former induce symplectic and the latter
antisymplectic congruences.

{\bf Example (continued).} For $p=7$, after Steps 1--3, there
are~$255$ reducible sets of isogeny classes with isomorphic
semisimplification, of size up to~$76$.  Step~5 refines these into
smaller subsets which have actually isomorphic $7$-torsion modules, of
which $337$ are nontrivial: $276$ sets of size~$2$, $52$ of size~$3$
and~$9$ of size~$4$.  Finally, after considering all the isogenous
curves (as in Step~4) there are 421 congruent pairs: 262 symplectic
and 159 antisymplectic.

For $p\ge11$ there are no reducible cases to consider.

\subsection{Twists}
If there is a mod~$p$ congruence between two elliptic curves~$E_1$
and~$E_2$, then for any $d\in\Q^*$ there will also be a congruence
(usually of the same symplectic type) between their quadratic twists
$E_1^d$ and~$E_2^d$: see Proposition~\ref{P:twist-cong}.
Nevertheless, it is hard to say precisely how many congruences there
in the database ``up to twist'', since twisting changes conductor (in
general), so we may have a set of mutually $7$-congruent elliptic
curves in the database, but with one or more of their twists not in
the database, so the twisted set in our data will be smaller.

Instead, to have a measure of how many congruences we have found up
to twist, we simply report on how many distinct $j$-invariants we
found, excluding as before curves which are only congruent to
isogenous curves.  For $p=7$ there are $\numprint{10348}$ distinct
$j$-invariants of curves with irreducible mod~$7$ representations
which are congruent to at least one non-isogenous curve, and $358$
distinct $j$-invariants in the reducible case.

For $p=11$ there are $191$ distinct $j$-invariants and for $p=13$
there are $39$.  For $p=17$, all $17$-congruent isogeny classes
consist of single curves, the eight pairs are quadratic twists, and
the $j$-invariants of the curves in each pair are
$48412981936758748562855/77853743274432041397$ and $-46585/243$.  One
such pair of $17$-congruent curves consists of $\lmfdbec{47775}{b}{1}$
and~$\lmfdbec{3675}{b}{1}$.

\section{Evidence for the Frey-Mazur conjecture in the database}
\label{S:Frey-Mazur}

\begin{theorem}
 \label{T:cong19}
 Let $p \geq 19$ be a prime. Let $E/\Q$ and~$E'/\Q$ be elliptic curves
 with conductors at most~$\numprint{400000}$.  Suppose that $E[p]
 \simeq E'[p]$ as $G_\Q$-modules. Then $E$ and $E'$ are
 $\Q$-isogenous.
 \end{theorem}
\begin{proof} Let~$p \geq 5$ be a prime. Let $N_E$ and $\Delta_E$ 
denote the conductor and the minimal discriminant of $E$, respectively. Write also $\tilde{N}_E$ to denote~$N_E$ away from~$p$ and let $N_p$ be the Serre level (i.e. the Artin conductor away from~$p$) of~$\rhobar_{E,p}$. 
We have $N_p \mid \tilde{N}_E$.

Recall that the conductor of an elliptic curve at primes~$p \geq 5$ divides~$p^2$. Moreover, from Kraus~\cite[p. 30]{KrausThesis}
it follows that, for each $\ell \neq p$, if 
$\vv_{\ell}(N_p) \neq \vv_{\ell}(N_E) = \vv_{\ell}(\tilde{N}_E)$ then
$\vv_{\ell}(N_E) = 1$ and $p \mid \vv_{\ell}(\Delta_E)$.
Therefore, we can find primes $q_i \nmid pN_p$ such that 
\begin{equation}\label{E:condE}
  N_E = p^s \cdot N_p \cdot q_0 \cdot \ldots \cdot q_n, 
 \qquad p \mid \vv_{q_i}(\Delta_E), \qquad 0 \leq s \leq 2
\end{equation}
where the number of~$q_i$ occurring is $\geq 1$ if and only if 
$\tilde{N}_E \neq N_p$. 

Now let $E'/\Q$ be another elliptic curve satisfying $E[p] \simeq E'[p]$ as $G_\Q$-modules. Write $N_{E'}$, $\tilde{N}_{E'}$, $\Delta_{E'}$, $N'_p$ and $\rhobar_{E',p}$ to denote analogous quantities attached to~$E'$. We have $N'_p \mid \tilde{N}_{E'}$.

By assumption, we have $\rhobar_{E',p} \simeq \rhobar_{E,p}$ so these representations have the same Serre level, i.e. $N_p = N_p'$ and (similarly as for~$E$) we can find primes~$q_i' \nmid pN'_p$ such that~$N_{E'}$ factors as
\begin{equation}\label{E:condE'}
 N_{E'} = p^{s'} \cdot N_p \cdot q'_0 \cdot \ldots \cdot q'_m, 
 \qquad p \mid \vv_{q'_i}(\Delta_E'),
 \qquad 0 \leq s' \leq 2.
\end{equation}
The representations $\rhobar_{E,p}$ and $\rhobar_{E',p}$ also have the same Serre weights $k$ and $k'$, respectively. Note that for $s=0$ ($E$ has good reduction at~$p$) we have $k=2$ and for $s=1$ ($E$ has multiplicative reduction at~$p$) we have $k=2$ if $p \mid \vv_p(\Delta_E)$ or $k=p+1$ otherwise (see for example \cite[p. 3]{KrausThesis}); moreover, for $s=2$ it follows from \cite[Th\'eor\`eme 1]{KrausThesis} that $k \not\in \{2, p+1\}$ 
for $p \geq 19$. Similar conclusions apply to $E'$, $s'$ and $k'$. 
Therefore, we have 2 cases: (i) if $s = 2$ or $s=1$ and $p \nmid \vv_{p}(\Delta_E)$ then $s'=s$; (ii) if $s=0$ or $s=1$ and $p \mid \vv_{p}(\Delta_E)$ then $s' \in \{0,1 \}$.

Suppose $E'$ is a non-isogenous curve with the same conductor. Taking differences of traces of Frobenius at different primes shows that 
there are no congruence between any two of them for $p \geq 19$, otherwise $p$ needs to divide the differences (see (1) below). 
Thus $N_E \neq N_{E'}$.

Suppose $\tilde{N}_E = \tilde{N}_{E'}$, so that the only difference in the conductors is at~$p$. From the possibilities above for the Serre weights, after interchanging $E$ and $E'$ if needed, 
we can assume $s=1$ and $s'=0$ and we also know that $p \mid \vv_p(\Delta_E)$. On the other hand, if $\tilde{N}_E \neq \tilde{N}_{E'}$ then, after interchanging $E$ and $E'$ if needed, we have $N_p \neq \tilde{N}_E$ and so there is at least one prime~$q_i \neq p$ appearing in the factorization~\eqref{E:condE}, which in particular satisfies $p \mid \vv_{q_i}(\Delta_E)$.

Let $\calM_E$ be the set of pairs $(q,p)$ where $q$ is a multiplicative prime of~$E$ and
$p \geq 19$ is a prime satisfying $p \mid \vv_{q}(\Delta_E)$.
Note that we can have $q=p$. Let $\calM_{E'}$ be the analogous set for~$E'$. From the previous paragraph we conclude that 
$p$ has to occurs in the second entry of one of the pairs~$(q,p)$ in~$\calM_E$ or $\calM_{E'}$.

To complete the proof, we carried out the following computations on
the LMFDB database of all elliptic curves defined over~$\Q$ and
conductor at most~$\numprint{400000}$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For each $N\le \numprint{400000}$ and each pair of non-isogenous
  curves~$E_1,E_2$ of conductor~$N$ (if there are at least two such
  isogeny classes), we computed $\gcd_{\ell\le B,
    \ell\nmid N}(a_{\ell}(E_1)-a_{\ell}(E_2))$ for increasing~$B$
  until the value of the $\gcd$ was~${}\le17$.  The success of this
  computation shows that there are no congruences mod~$p$ between
  non-isogenous curves of the same conductor for $p\ge19$.
\item For one curve~$E$ in each isogeny class we computed the set
  $\calM_E$ from the conductor and minimal discriminant.  We found that
  the largest prime~$p$ occurring in any~$\calM_E$ was~$97$: in fact,
  all~$p$ with $19\le p\le97$ occur except for~$p=89$.  Hence any
  mod~$p$ congruence between non-isogenous curves in the database must
  have~$p\le97$.  In view of the computations of
  Section~\ref{S:statistics}, there are no such congruences for $19\le
  p\le97$.

  Note that the set~$\calM_E$ is unchanged if we replace $E$ by a curve
  isogenous to it, provided that the isogeny has degree divisible only
  by primes less than~$19$.  But the only curves defined over~$\Q$ with
  isogenies of prime degree~$p\ge19$ are the CM curves for
  $p=19,43,67,163$, which have no multiplicative primes, and the pairs
  of $37$-isogenous curves, which have the same property (the smallest
  conductor being $1225=5^2\cdot7^2$).  Hence in this step it suffices
  to consider just one curve in each isogeny class.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

%% Finally, given~$E$ in the database, we compute $\calM_E$ (which is
%% a finite set) and for each~$p$ occuring in a pair of $\calM_E$ we
%% compute the set of conductors~$\calL_{E,p}$ satisfying the
%% factorisation~\eqref{E:condE'} and still in the database (i.e. up
%% to 400000). For each conductor $N_{E'} \in \calL_{E,p}$ we verify
%% there is no elliptic curve~$E'$ of conductor $N_{E'}$ congruent

%% We end by remarking that a congruence between $E$ and $E'$ can

%% arguments above show that in such case $p$ occurs in $\calM_{E'}$,
%% therefore we will detect this congruence at a laters stage as we
%% run over all the curves in the database.
