\begin{frame}\frametitle{Elliptic Curves}
In this talk we consider elliptic curves over a number field~$K$, for
example ~$K=\Q$.

If we need explicit equations we'll use short Weierstrass models
\[  E_{a,b}:\quad Y^2 = X^3+aX+b
\]
with $a,b\in K$ such that $4 a^{3} + 27 b^{2} \not=0$. \pause

The set of $K$-rational points $E(K)$ forms an abelian group.

For $m\ge2$ we denote by $E[m]$ the \high{$m$-torsion subgroup}:
\[
  E[m] = \{ P \in E(\Kbar) \mid mP=0 \}.
  \]
  \pause
  We have $E[m]\cong (\Z/mZ)^2$ as abelian groups.
  \medskip
  
  But $E[m]$ carries additional structure\dots.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Mod $p$ Galois representations}
  Let $G_K=\Gal(\Kbar/K)$, the \high{absolute Galois group} of~$K$.
  This acts on $E(\Kbar)$ by acting on coordinates:
  \[
   P=(x,y)\in E(\Kbar), \quad\sigma\in G_K:\qquad
   \sigma(P)=(\sigma(x),\sigma(y))\in E(\Kbar).
   \]
   \pause
 The Galois action preserves the group structure:
   \[
   \sigma(P+Q)=\sigma(P)+\sigma(Q).
   \]
   Hence each $E[m]$ is a \high{$G_K$-module}.
   \pause\medskip

   Taking $m=p$ prime, $E[p]$ is a $2$-dimensional vector space
   over~$\F_p$.  Fixing a basis of $E[p]$ we obtain the \high{mod~$p$
   Galois representation}
   \[
   \rhobar_{E,p}: G_K \to \GL_2(\F_p).
   \]

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{The Weil pairing}
  As well as being a vector space, $E[p]$ admits a \high{symplectic
    structure}: there is a non-degenerate alternating bilinear
  pairing, the \high{Weil pairing}
  \[
  e_p = e_{E,p}:\quad E[p]\times E[p] \to \mu_p
  \]
  where~$\mu_p$ denotes the group of $p$th roots of unity in
  $\Qbar^*$.
  \pause\medskip

  The Weil pairing is \high{Galois equivariant}:
  \[
  e_p(\sigma(P),\sigma(Q)) = \sigma(e_p(P,Q)) = e_p(P,Q)^{\chi_p(\sigma)}
  \]
  where $\chi_p:G_K\to\F_p^*$ is the cyclotomic character.

  \pause\medskip This Galois-equivariant symplectic structure on $E[p]$ is
  what we are interested in.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Congruences and their symplectic types}
  We are interested in the situation where two \high{different} curves have
  \high{isomorphic} $p$-torsion modules.
  \pause\medskip

  $E_1$ and $E_2$ are said to satisfy a \high{mod~$p$ congruence} if
  there is a bijective map
  \[
  \phi:\quad E_1[p] \to E_2[p]
  \]
  which is both $\F_p$-linear and $G_K$-equivariant, \textit{i.e.}, is
  an isomorphism of $G_K$-modules.
  \pause\medskip

  To each such~$\phi$ there is a constant $d_{\phi}\in\F_p^*$ such
  that
  \[
  e_{E_2,p}(\phi(P),\phi(Q)) = e_{E_1,p}(P,Q)^{d_{\phi}}.
  \]

  We say that $\phi$ is \high{symplectic} if $d_{\phi}$ is a
  \high{square} mod~$p$ and \high{anti-symplectic} otherwise.
\end{frame}

%% \begin{frame}\frametitle{Pedantic remarks}
%%   \begin{itemize}
%%     \item This is uninteresting for $p=2$ so we'll assume that $p$ is
%%       \high{odd}.

%%     \item The Weil pairing is not well-defined by the properties
%%       given.  If $E[p]$ has $G_K$-automorphisms we can compose with
%%       $e_p$ to get a new pairing which will equal $e_p^k$ for some
%%       $k\in\F_p^*$.

%%       But if $E[p]$ is \high{irreducible} as
%%       $G_K$-module then the only such automorphisms are scalar
%%       multiplications, for which $k$ is a square.  We will only talk
%%       about the symplectic type of isomorphisms between irreducible
%%       modules: this \high{is} well-defined.
%%   \end{itemize}
%% \end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Isogenies}
  Isogenies between curves provide one source of congruences.
  \pause\medskip

  Let $\phi:E_1\to E_2$ be an isogeny$/K$ of degree~$\deg(\phi)$
  \high{coprime to $p$}, defined over~$K$.  Then $\phi$ induces an
  $\F_pG_K$-isomorphism $E_1[p]\to E_2[p]$.  The \high{isogeny criterion}
  says that $\phi$ is symplectic if and only if the Legendre symbol
  $({\deg(\phi)}/{p})=+1$.
  \pause\medskip

  \begin{proof}
    Using Weil reciprocity, for $P,Q\in E_1[p]$,
    \[
    \begin{aligned}
      e_{E_2,p}(\phi(P), \phi(Q)) &= e_{E_1,p}(P, \hat\phi\phi(Q)) \\
      &= e_{E_1,p}(P, \deg(\phi)(Q))\\ &= e_{E_1,p}(P,
      Q)^{\deg(\phi)},
    \end{aligned}
  \]
  where $\hat{\phi}$ denotes the dual isogeny, since $\hat\phi\phi=\deg(\phi)$.
  \end{proof}
  \pause\medskip

  Do any other mod~$p$ congruences exist?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{The Frey-Mazur conjecture}
  The \high{Uniform Frey--Mazur conjecture} (over $\Q$) states:

  \begin{quote}There is a constant $C=C_{\Q}$ such that, if $E_1/\Q$ and $E_2/\Q$
  satisfy $E_1[p] \simeq E_2[p]$ as $G_\Q$-modules for some prime $p >
  C$, then $E_1$ and $E_2$ are $\Q$-isogenous.
  \end{quote}

  \pause\medskip

  \begin{theorem}[C. \& Freitas]
  If $E_1/\Q$ and~$E_2/\Q$ both have conductor ${}\le\numprint{400000}$
  are not isogenous, and satisfy $E_1[p] \simeq E_2[p]$ as
  $G_\Q$-modules for some prime $p$, then $p\le17$.
  \end{theorem}

  \pause\medskip
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A stronger version of the Frey--Mazur conjecture states that
      it is holds with $C=23$.
      \item Congruences for small~$p$ are common; for $p=17$ there is
        essentially only one known, between $\lmfdbec{47775}{be}{1}$
        and~$\lmfdbec{3675}{b}{1}$.
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Finding congruences in the LMFDB database}
The \LMFDB\ database contains all elliptic curves defined over~$\Q$ of
conductor up to $\numprint{400000}$: that is $\numprint{2483649}$
curves in $\numprint{1741002}$ isogeny classes.

What congruences are there between (non-isogenous) curves, and how do
we find them?

Two representations have isomorphic semisimplifications if and only if
they have the same traces. We can test this condition by testing
whether
\[ a_{\ell}(E_1)\equiv a_{\ell}(E_2)\pmod{p}
\quad \text{for all primes } \ell \nmid pN_1N_2,
\] 
where $N_1$ and $N_2$ are the conductors of~$E_1$ and $E_2$.

But there are infinitely many primes~$\ell$.  And for each curve we need to
ignore a different bad set!
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Sieving}
  To get around these issues we use a \high{sieve} with a hash
  function, and only test $\ell>\numprint{400000}$.

  Let $\LL_B=\{\ell_0,\dots,\ell_{B-1}\}$ be the set of the $B$
  smallest primes greater than $\numprint{400000}$.  For each $p$ we
  define the hash of $E$ to be
  \[\sum_{i=0}^{B-1}\overline{a}_{\ell_i}(E)p^i\in\Z.\]

 Any two $p$-congruent curves (up to semisimplification) have the same
 hash value.  If $B$ is not too small then we will get few (if any)
 ``false positive'' clashes.

  We can also parallelise this with respect to~$p$, so that we only
  need to compute each $a_{\ell}(E)$ once.  Against each hash value,
  we store lists of curves which have that $p$-hash (processing the
  curves one at a time, one from each isogeny class).  At the end we
  extract the lists of size at least~$2$, to give us sets of curves
  which are likely to all be $p$-congruent. % (up to  semisimplification).

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Sieving in practice}
  This works well in practice with $B=40$. Not quite with $B=35$!

  \pause
  \medskip
  The curves with labels $\lmfdbec{25921}{a}{1}$ and
  $\lmfdbec{78400}{gw}{1}$ have traces $a_{\ell}$ which are \high{equal
    for all~$\ell\in\LL_{35}$}, that is, for all~$\ell$ with
  $400000\le \ell<400457$ (though not for the 36th $\ell=400457$).
  \pause
  \medskip

  Note on reducibility: here we are testing for $p$-congruence only up
  to semisimplification.  For curves with $E[p]$ reducible
  (\textit{i.e.}, which have a rational $p$-isogeny) this is a weaker
  condition than $p$-congruence, and we need to carry out further
  tests.

    \pause
  \medskip
  We also need to test whether curves which appear to be $p$-congruent
  after sieving actually are.  With $B=40$ this is always the case.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Sieving results}
  For $5\le p\le 97$ we find the following number of sets of more than
  one mutually $p$-congruent curves (up to semisimplification,
  ignoring isogenies):

  %% p=5: 102043 subsets (101717 irred, 326 red) sizes up to 18
  %% (irred), 430 (red)
  %% p=7: 20138 subsets (19883 irred, 255 red) sizes up to 5 (irred),
  %% 76 (red)
  %% p=11: 635 subsets, size 2, all irred
  %% p=13: 150, size 2, all irred
  %% p=17: 8, size 2, all irred
  %% p>=19: none
  \[
  \begin{tabular}{||c||c|c|c|c|c||}
    \hline
    $p$ & \#sets & \# irred. & max.irred. & \# red. & max. red.\\
    \hline
    5 & 102043 & 101717 & 18 & 326 & 430 \\
    7 & 20138 & 19883 & 5 & 255 & 76 \\
    11 & 635 & 635 & 2 & 0 & - \\
    13 & 150 & 150 & 2 & 0 & - \\
    17 & 8 & 8 & 2 & 0 & - \\
    19$\le p\le$ 97 & 0 & 0 & - & 0 & - \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \]

After eliminating reducibles which are not isomorphic, for $p=7$ we
find $337$ non-trivial sets, of size up to~$4$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Distinguishing symplectic from
    anti-symplectic}

  Freitas and Kraus have a long paper (to appear) which gives many different
  \high{local criteria} for determining whether a congruence
  $E_1[p]\cong E_2[p]$ is symplectic or anti-symplectic.  These
  criteria are not guaranteed to apply in all cases, but usually do,
  and are usually fast.  They depend on knowing in advance that a
  congruence does hold.

\pause\medskip

  There are several tests involving the structure of $E[p]$ at primes
  of bad reduction; these are all fast.  Then there are two tests
  involving primes of good reduction, one of which is slow.

\pause\medskip

  This test suite has now been implemented, and the tests are powerful
  enough to handle \high{all} the congruences in the database.\pause

  There are congruences (outside the database) for which none of the
  local criteria apply; we developed some new global methods to handle
  these.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Using modular curves}

  For $p=7$ we use a method based on \high{modular curves} to
  establish congruences and their symplectic type.    \pause

 For each prime $p$ there is a modular curve $X(p)$ defined over $\Q$
 which parametrises elliptic curves together with a level $p$ structure
 (essentially, a marked basis for $E[p]$).    \pause

 For $p\le5$, this curve has genus~$0$, and $p$-congruences are very
 common.

 $X(7)$ has genus $3$, and the Klein quartic is one model for it.
 $X(11)$ has genus~$26$.

    \pause
  \medskip
  Fix one elliptic curve~$E$ over $\Q$.  Then there exists a curve
  $X_E^+(p)$ (or simply $X_E(p)$), which is a twist of $X(p)$, whose
  (non-cuspidal) points correspond to curves $E'$ with $E[p]\cong
  E'[p]$ symplectically.

  {\small(Strictly, to pairs $(E',\alpha)$ where $\alpha:E[p]\to E'[p]$ is a
  symplectic isomorphism, up to scaling.)}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{The modular curves $X_E^{\pm}(p)$}
As well as $X_E^+(p)$, there is another twist $X_E^-(p)$ parametrizing
curves $E'$ which are anti-symplectically isomorphic to~$E$.  \pause
  \medskip

An explicit model for $X_E^+(7)$ was found by Kraus and Halberstadt
(2003) together with the degree~$168$ map $j:X_E^+(7)\to X(1)=\PP^1$
(giving the $j$-invariant of the congruent curve $E'$), and incomplete
formulas for the coefficients of $E'$. A model for $X_E^-(7)$ was
given by Poonen, Schaefer and Stoll.

    \pause
  \medskip
More complete formulas were provided by Fisher (2014), who also gave
all the formulas for $X_E^-(7)$ parametrizing anti-symplectic
congruences, and $X_E^{\pm}(11)$ (which has genus~$26$).

    \pause
  \medskip
For $p=7$ we implemented these formulas and apply them as follows.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Using $X_E^{\pm}(7)$: the algorithm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given two elliptic curves $E$, $E'$ defined over a field~$K$ of
  characteristic~$0$. We do not need to assume anything about them.
  Compute $j(E')$, and the curves $X_E^{\pm}(7)$.
\item Use the explicit map $j:X_E^+(7)\to\PP^1$ to find the preimages
  (if any) of $j(E')$ in $X_E^+(7)(K)$.  If none then $E,E'$ are not
  symplectically $p$-congruent over~$K$.
\item For any $P\in X_E^+(7)(K)$ use Fisher's formulas to find a model
  for the associated congruent curve $E''$.
\item If $E'\cong E''$ for any of these, then $E,E'$ are
  symplectically $p$-congruent
  over $K$, otherwise not.
\item repeat steps 3--5 with $X_E^-(7)$.
\end{enumerate}
\pause
It would be possible to implement a similar algorithm for $p=11$ using
Fisher's formulas.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Using $X_E^{\pm}(7)$: results}
Of the $\numprint{19883}$ non-trivial sets of isogeny classes with mutually
isomorphic irreducible mod~$7$ representations, we find that in
$\numprint{12394}$ cases all the isomorphisms are symplectic, while in the
remaining $\numprint{7489}$ cases anti-symplectic isomorphisms occur.
\medskip
\pause

We successfully checked that in all these cases, the results of
applying the local criteria are consistent.  At the same time we found
that for all pairs of $7$-congruent curves in the database, at least
one of the local criteria are able to decide whether the congruence
was symplectic or not.

%% For example, there are $5092$ pairs of curves with irreducible mod~$7$
%% representations which are anti-symplectically congruent.  Of these,
%% the faster local criteria (at bad primes) work in $5090$ cases but the
%% remaining two required the good prime criteria.

%% Of $411$ pairs of $7$-congruent reducible pairs, the faster local
%% tests work in $245$ cases but not the remaining $166$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Results for $p>7$}
For $p\ge11$ we used the local criteria only to test congruences.

It would be possible to implement Fisher's formulas for
$X_E^{\pm}(11)$, but we have not yet done so.

For $11\le p\le 17$ we only find congruences with $E[p]$ irreducible
and we never find sets of more than two congruent curves (excluding
isogenies).


  \[
  \begin{tabular}{||c||c|c|c||}
    \hline
    $p$ & \# congruent pairs & \# symplectic & \# anti-symplectic\\
    \hline
    11 & 635 & 446 & 189 \\
    13 & 150 & 88 & 62 \\
    17 & 8 & 0 & 8 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \]
%% for $p=11$, of the $635$ congruent pairs of isogeny classes, $446$ are
%% symplectic and $189$ are anti-symplectic; for $p=13$, of the $150$
%% congruent pairs of isogeny classes, $88$ are symplectic and $62$ are
%% anti-symplectic; for $p=17$, all of the $8$ congruent pairs of isogeny
%% classes are anti-symplectic.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{The Frey--Mazur conjecture}
  For $17 < p < 100$ we found no congruences in the database.

  We also \high{proved} that there are no congruences (in the
  database) for $p>100$.

  This would be possible, though time-consuming, by considering all
  pairs of curves (one from each isogeny class). Instead:

  \medskip\pause

  \high{First}: compare non-isogenous curves of the same conductor, by
  computing $\gcd_{\ell\le B, \ell\nmid
    N}(a_{\ell}(E_1)-a_{\ell}(E_2))$ for increasing~$B$.

  \medskip\pause

  \begin{lemma}
    If $E_1$ and $E_2$ have different conductors $N_1$ and $N_2$
  and are $p$-congruent for some $p\ge5$, then for $i=1$ or $i=2$ there exists a
  prime~$q\mid\mid N_i$ such that $p\mid\ord_q(\Delta_i)$, where
  $\Delta_i$ is the minimal discriminant of~$E_i$.
  \end{lemma}
  \begin{lemma}
  If $N_E\le 400000$ and $q\mid\mid N_E$ and $p\mid\ord_q(\Delta_E)$
  then $p\le97$.
  \end{lemma}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Twists}
As well as computational results, we also have some results of a
more theoretical nature.  Many of these involve \high{twists}.

\pause\medskip
First, it is easy to show that when we have a congruence $E_1[p]\cong
E_2[p]$ then for any quadratic twist (associated to a quadratic
extension $K(\sqrt{d})/K$), the twisted curves also satisfy a
$p$-congruence: $E_1^d[p]\cong E_2^d[p]$.  Moreover the symplectic
type is preserved.
%% except in one very special situation${}^*$.

\pause\medskip
So the previous tables could have only shown the number of congruences
``up to twist''.  (But twisting changes the conductor in general.)
However, we can count the total number of curves, up to twist,
appearing in any of the congruences we found.

%% \pause\medskip
%% \begin{example}[${}^*$]
%% $E_1=\lmfdbec{32}{a}{1}$ is symplectically $5$-congruent to
%% $E_2=\lmfdbec{608}{b}{1}$, but $E_1^{-1}=\lmfdbec{32}{a}{2}$ is
%% anti-symplectically $5$-congruent to $E_2^{-1}=\lmfdbec{608}{e}{1}$.
%% \end{example}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Congruences up to twist}
For $p=7$ there are $\numprint{10348}$ distinct $j$-invariants of
curves with irreducible mod~$7$ representations which are congruent to
at least one non-isogenous curve, and $358$ distinct $j$-invariants in
the reducible case.\pause\ \ \   (There are $\numprint{1012376}$ different $j$ in
all.)

\pause\medskip
For $p=11$ there are $191$ distinct $j$-invariants.

For $p=13$ there are $39$.

For $p=17$ there are just 2:\ \ \ \pause all eight $17$-congruent isogeny
classes consist of single curves, the eight pairs are quadratic
twists, and the $j$-invariants of the curves in each pair are
$48412981936758748562855/77853743274432041397$ and $-46585/243$.  One
such pair of $17$-congruent curves consists of $\lmfdbec{47775}{b}{1}$
and~$\lmfdbec{3675}{b}{1}$.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Congruences between twists I}
With some mild conditions to exclude very small images we have a
correspondence between the following situations, for odd $p$ over any
number field $K$:
\begin{itemize}
\item the projective image in $\PGL_2(\F_p)$ being dihedral;
\item the image being contained in the normaliser $N$ of a Cartan
  subgroup $C$, but not contained in $C$;
  \item a $p$-congruence between quadratic twists: $E[p]\cong E^d[p]$.
\end{itemize}
\pause\medskip

- in the second situation, $C$ cuts out a quadratic extension
$K(\sqrt{d})/K$ and $\rhobar_{E,p}(\sigma)\equiv0\pmod{p}$ whenever
$\sigma(\sqrt{d})=-\sqrt{d}$.  Hence $\rhobar_{E,p}$ and
$\rhobar_{E^d,p}$ have the same traces, so are equivalent (if
irreducible).
\pause\medskip

- the converse is similar.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Congruences between twists II}
  In this situation we can easily determine whether the congruence is
  symplectic:
  \pause  \medskip

  \begin{prop}
  If $\phi:\ E[p]\cong E^d[p]$ with image contained in $N\supseteq C$ a
  Cartan normaliser, then%%${}^*$
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\phi$ is symplectic if $C$ is split and $p\equiv1\pmod4$ or
      if $C$ is nonsplit and $p\equiv3\pmod4$;
      \item $\phi$ is anti-symplectic if $C$ is split and $p\equiv3\pmod4$ or
      if $C$ is nonsplit and $p\equiv1\pmod4$.
  \end{enumerate}

  %% \pause \medskip ${}^*$With one exception: when $j(E)=1728$, the
  %% congruence $E[p]\cong E^{-1}[p]$ is symplectic iff $2$ is a
  %% quadratic residue mod~$p$.
  \end{prop}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Congruences between twists III}
  Normally there can be no more than one congruence between $E$ and a
  quadratic twist.  The exception is when the projective image is
  $C_2\times C_2$.

  \pause\medskip

  \begin{prop}
    Suppose that $\rhobar_{E,p}$ has projective image $C_2\times
    C_2$.  Then there are \high{three} quadratic twists $E^{d_i}$
    which are $p$-congruent to~$E$.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If $\sqrt{p^*}\in K$ then all three congruences are symplectic;
    \item Otherwise one is the symplectic congruence $E[p]\cong
      E^{p^*}[p]$, and the other two are anti-symplectic.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{prop}
  $p^*=\pm p\equiv1\pmod4$, and $\sqrt{p^*}\in K$ iff
  $\PP\rhobar_{E,p}(G_K)\subseteq\PSL_2(\F_p)$.

  \pause\medskip

  \begin{example}
  $E=\lmfdbec{6534}{a}{1}$, of conductor $6534=2\cdot3^3\cdot11^2$ is
  symplectically $3$-congruent to $E^{-3}=\lmfdbec{6534}{v}{1}$, and
  anti-symplectically to $E^{-11}=\lmfdbec{6534}{p}{1}$ and
  $E^{33}=\lmfdbec{6534}{h}{1}$.
  \end{example}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Quartic twists}
  Curves of the form $E_a:\ Y^2=X^3+aX$ have $j(E_a)=1728$ and CM
  by~$\sqrt{-1}$, and admit \high{quartic twists} $E_a\sim E_{ta}$,
  parametrized by $t\in K^*/(K^*)^4$.

  \pause\medskip

  \begin{prop}
  The only $p$-congruence between these curves is the one induced by
  the $2$-isogeny: $E_a[p]\cong E_{-4a}[p]$.
  \end{prop}
  \pause\medskip

  This is only non-trivial when $\sqrt{-1}\notin K$, as otherwise the
  curves themselves are isomorphic (since $-4=(1+\sqrt{-1})^4$).

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Sextic twists}
  Curves of the form $E_b:\ Y^2=X^3+b$ have $j(E_b)=0$ and CM
  by~$\sqrt{-3}$, and admit \high{sextic twists} $E_b\sim E_{tb}$,
  parametrized by $t\in K^*/(K^*)^6$.

  \pause\medskip

  During our computations with $p=7$ we noticed something which led to
  the following.

  \pause\medskip

  \begin{prop}
  Assume $\sqrt{-3}\notin K$.  The only $7$-congruences between these
  are:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $E_b[7]\cong E_{-27b}[7]$, anti-symplectic (induced by a
    $3$-isogeny);
  \item $E_b[7] \cong E_{-28/b}[7]$, symplectic;
  \item $E_b[7] \cong E_{27\cdot28/b}[7]$, anti-symplectic (composite of
    previous).
  \end{itemize}
  \end{prop}
  \pause\medskip

  We hope to generalise this to other primes~$p$.
