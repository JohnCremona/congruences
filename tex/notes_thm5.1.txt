Notes on reading Thm 5.1

1. Derive the factorization of N_E (first displayed equation) before
mentioning another curve E', only assuming p>3, as this really only
sets notation.  (Complete the Kraus reference.)

2. Now introduce the notation for E' and say that they have the same
N_p (reference?).

3. Organise the rest a little differently with fewer references to the
database and implementation strategy.  Really there are two steps,
given any curve E of conductor N_E:

(a) Check that E is not congruent to any other curve E' of the same
conductor (using the method you give).  We can implement this since we
have the complete set of curves of each conductor up to some bound.

(b) Compute the set M_E.  This already gives a finite set of p for
which is is possible that E might be congruent to another curve mod p
(so we can finish with E if none of these p>17).

(c) Otherwise, for each relevant p from M_E, check that E is not
congruent to curves E' of smaller conductor, again a finite set.  As
you say, N_E' is constrained (and we need to get this condition
correct!).

Now the overall strategy is simply to apply the above to every curve
in the database (up to isogeny).  I cannot see the advantage of going
from largest conductor downwards!
